            Borrowing decisions usually go wrong for predictable reasons: the monthly payment is treated as the whole story, the total cost is ignored, and structural details are misunderstood until they become expensive. A clean repayment baseline starts with a standard payment view, because a figure like “R3,200 per month” only means something once it is tied to amount, rate, term, and repayment frequency, which is exactly what the loan payment calculator clarifies. Affordability is the next failure point, since approval and affordability are not the same thing; lenders can approve commitments that leave no buffer for volatility, while borrowers undercount fixed obligations and overestimate steady income. Comparison thinking fixes a different trap: two offers can feel similar because the payment is close, yet one can be materially more expensive once term length, interest accumulation, and repayment timing are made explicit. Personal loan EMI framing is useful for quick standardisation, but it becomes misleading when people assume “EMI” guarantees fairness or when compounding and repayment cadence are glossed over. The interest model itself matters: simple interest is often assumed when the loan is actually amortising, while compound interest quietly punishes longer timelines and small rate differences by magnifying total repayment over time. Structure risk shows up most clearly in interest-only and balloon arrangements, where early payments can look comfortable while principal remains intact, leaving a sharp cliff later that depends on refinancing, asset values, or future cash flow that may not exist. Once the decision is made, amortisation schedules remove self-deception by showing how slowly principal falls in the early months and where interest is actually being paid across the timeline. Extra payments then become a strategy question rather than a motivational one; paying down principal earlier can compress years of interest, but only if the payment is applied correctly and the borrower understands the trade-off between liquidity and debt reduction. If you want the full, expanded reference version that connects these tools and shows how to interpret them without relying on sales framing, use the SnapCalc hub page:

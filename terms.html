                This website provides general-purpose calculators intended for
                personal use, education, and basic planning. The tools do not
                constitute financial, legal, tax, investment, medical,
                engineering, or professional advice.
              </p>

              <h2>3. No Professional Advice</h2>
              <p>
                Calculations, outputs, interpretations, and results are for
                informational purposes only. You must verify all results
                independently. You assume all responsibility for decisions made

              <p>
                The calculators rely on formulas, assumptions, and user inputs
                that may not reflect real-world systems or your specific
                situation. No guarantee is made that any result is complete,
                accurate, or up to date.
              </p>

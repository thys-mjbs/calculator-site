                These Terms &amp; Conditions govern your access to and use of SnapCalc,
                including all calculators, utilities, pages, content, and related features.
                The site is provided for general informational and educational purposes.
                If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the website.
              </p>

              <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
              <p>
                By accessing, browsing, or using SnapCalc, you confirm that you have read,
                understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions and any
                additional notices or policies referenced on this site (including the
                Privacy Policy and Disclaimer). If you do not accept these Terms, you must
                discontinue use of the site.
              </p>

              <h2>2. Purpose of SnapCalc</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc provides a large collection of practical calculators and utilities
                intended to help users estimate values, explore scenarios, and improve
                clarity when working with numbers. The tools are designed for personal use,
                basic planning, learning, and general reference. They are not designed to
                replace professional judgement, official sources, or regulated advice.
              </p>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may include utilities spanning multiple fields, including but not
                limited to personal finance, business, education, engineering, construction,
                health and fitness, time and scheduling, conversions, travel, and real estate.
                Each tool is provided as a general-purpose aid and may rely on simplified
                assumptions that do not reflect your specific circumstances.
              </p>

              <h2>3. No Professional Advice</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc does not provide financial, legal, tax, investment, medical,
                engineering, or other professional advice. The results produced by any
                calculator or utility are for informational purposes only. You are solely
                responsible for verifying the accuracy and appropriateness of any result
                before relying on it for decisions, purchases, contracts, health actions,
                engineering work, compliance obligations, or any other real-world outcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you require professional advice, you should consult a qualified and
                licensed professional who can assess your situation directly and reference
                applicable laws, standards, regulations, or domain-specific requirements.
              </p>

              <h2>4. User Inputs and Assumptions</h2>
              <p>
                Calculator outputs depend on the inputs you provide and the assumptions
                built into the tool. If you enter incorrect, incomplete, unrealistic, or
                inconsistent values, results may be misleading. Tools may also include
                simplified formulas, rounding, default assumptions, or generic conversion
                factors. These assumptions may not match your region, industry, contract,
                or specific use case.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are responsible for ensuring that inputs are correct, units are
                consistent, and results are interpreted appropriately. Where a tool includes
                helper text, examples, or guidance, it is provided as general information
                and does not change your responsibility to validate outcomes.
              </p>

              <h2>5. Accuracy and Availability</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While care is
                taken to build tools that behave consistently, SnapCalc does not guarantee
                that any calculator, formula, output, or page content is error-free,
                complete, current, or suitable for any particular purpose. Tools may be
                updated, corrected, or refined over time as issues are discovered or as
                scope is improved.
              </p>
              <p>
                The site may occasionally be unavailable due to maintenance, platform
                limitations, hosting issues, or third-party service interruptions. SnapCalc
                does not guarantee uninterrupted access.
              </p>

              <h2>6. Personal Responsibility and Risk</h2>
              <p>
                You use SnapCalc at your own risk. You acknowledge that any action you take
                based on results from the site is your responsibility. You should not rely
                on SnapCalc for decisions where incorrect results could cause loss, harm,
                safety issues, compliance breaches, financial damage, or other serious
                consequences.
              </p>
              <p>
                SnapCalc is intended to support understanding and estimation, not to serve
                as an authoritative source, certified calculation system, or compliance tool.
              </p>

              <h2>7. Third-Party Links, Ads, and External Services</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may include links to third-party websites, services, resources, or
                tools. These links may appear within content, navigation elements, or
                advertising placements. SnapCalc does not control third-party sites and is
                not responsible for their availability, content, accuracy, security, or
                privacy practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you follow a third-party link, you do so at your own discretion and you
                should review the third party’s terms and privacy policies. SnapCalc is not
                responsible for any purchases, transactions, or outcomes associated with
                third-party sites.
              </p>

              <h2>8. Intellectual Property and Site Use</h2>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise stated, the design, structure, text, and presentation of
                SnapCalc are owned by the site operator or licensed for use. You may use
                SnapCalc for personal reference and normal browsing. You may not copy,
                reproduce, republish, sell, or distribute site content at scale without
                permission, except where allowed by applicable law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reasonable sharing of links to SnapCalc pages is allowed and encouraged. If
                you reference SnapCalc outputs elsewhere, you should treat them as estimates
                and not as verified, authoritative figures.
              </p>

              <h2>9. Prohibited Use</h2>
              <p>
                You agree not to misuse SnapCalc or attempt to interfere with the site’s
                operation. Prohibited actions include, but are not limited to:

              </ul>

              <h2>10. Changes to Tools, Content, and Features</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may add, remove, modify, or discontinue calculators, categories,
                utilities, or features at any time. Changes may be made to improve accuracy,
                clarity, usability, or site performance. The site is not obligated to
                maintain any specific calculator or feature indefinitely.

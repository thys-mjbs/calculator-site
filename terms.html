          <p>
            These Terms & Conditions govern your access to and use of SnapCalc,
            including all calculators, utilities, pages, content, and related
            features. By accessing or using SnapCalc, you agree to comply with these terms and any applicable laws. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the website.
            SnapCalc reserves the right to modify or update these terms at any time, and continued use of the site after such changes will constitute acceptance of those changes.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing or using SnapCalc, you confirm that you have read,
            understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions and
            any related policies referenced on this site, including the Privacy
            Policy and Disclaimer. If you do not accept these Terms, you must stop
            using the site immediately. By continuing to use the site, you agree to be bound by any updates or revisions to these terms, which will be posted on this page.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Purpose of SnapCalc</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc provides practical calculators and utilities intended to help
            users estimate values, explore scenarios, and improve clarity when
            working with numbers. The tools are designed for general reference,
            learning, and basic planning, and are not a substitute for professional
            judgement or official sources. SnapCalc is not responsible for any consequences arising from the use of its calculators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tools may span multiple fields including personal finance, business,
            education, engineering, construction, health and fitness, time and
            scheduling, conversions, travel, and real estate. Each tool relies on
            simplified assumptions and may not reflect your specific
            circumstances. SnapCalc is not liable for any discrepancies or inaccurate results that may arise due to user input errors or assumptions.
          </p>

          <h2>3. No professional advice</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc does not provide financial, legal, tax, investment, medical,
            engineering, or other professional advice. Results are provided for
            informational purposes only. You are responsible for verifying accuracy
            and suitability before relying on any output, and using the tools at your own risk. SnapCalc disclaims any liability arising from reliance on the results provided by its calculators.
          </p>
          <p>
            If professional advice is required, consult a qualified professional
            who can assess your situation directly. SnapCalc does not assume any responsibility for decisions made based on the information provided by the calculators.
          </p>

          <h2>4. User inputs and assumptions</h2>
          <p>
            Calculator outputs depend on the inputs provided and the assumptions
            built into each tool. Incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent inputs may
            produce misleading results. Assumptions may not match your region,
            industry, contract, or use case. SnapCalc is not liable for any inaccuracies resulting from these inputs or assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for ensuring that inputs are correct, units are
            consistent, and outputs are interpreted appropriately. SnapCalc may provide guidance on typical input formats, but ultimately it is the user’s responsibility to ensure data quality.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Accuracy and availability</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While care
            is taken to maintain consistency, no guarantee is made that calculators
            or content are error-free, complete, or current. SnapCalc does not warrant that the website will be uninterrupted or error-free. We will make reasonable efforts to correct issues as they arise but do not guarantee immediate resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access may occasionally be interrupted due to maintenance, hosting
            limitations, or third-party service issues. SnapCalc is not responsible for any disruptions in service.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Personal responsibility and risk</h2>
          <p>
            You use SnapCalc at your own risk. Any action taken based on results is
            your responsibility. Do not rely on the site for decisions where
            incorrect results could cause harm, loss, or compliance issues. SnapCalc is not responsible for any damages or losses incurred due to reliance on the tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            SnapCalc is not liable for any financial, legal, or personal damages arising from your use of the website or any actions taken based on its tools. We encourage users to consult appropriate professionals for high-stakes decisions.

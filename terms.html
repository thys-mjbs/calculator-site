          <p>
            These Terms &amp; Conditions govern your access to and use of SnapCalc,
            including all calculators, utilities, pages, content, and related
            features. The site is provided for general informational and educational
            purposes. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the website.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing or using SnapCalc, you confirm that you have read,
            understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions and
            any related policies referenced on this site, including the Privacy
            Policy and Disclaimer. If you do not accept these Terms, you must stop
            using the site.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Purpose of SnapCalc</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc provides practical calculators and utilities intended to help
            users estimate values, explore scenarios, and improve clarity when
            working with numbers. The tools are designed for general reference,
            learning, and basic planning, and are not a substitute for professional
            judgement or official sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tools may span multiple fields including personal finance, business,
            education, engineering, construction, health and fitness, time and
            scheduling, conversions, travel, and real estate. Each tool relies on
            simplified assumptions and may not reflect your specific
            circumstances.
          </p>

          <h2>3. No professional advice</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc does not provide financial, legal, tax, investment, medical,
            engineering, or other professional advice. Results are provided for
            informational purposes only. You are responsible for verifying accuracy
            and suitability before relying on any output.
          </p>
          <p>
            If professional advice is required, consult a qualified professional
            who can assess your situation directly.
          </p>

          <h2>4. User inputs and assumptions</h2>
          <p>
            Calculator outputs depend on the inputs provided and the assumptions
            built into each tool. Incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent inputs may
            produce misleading results. Assumptions may not match your region,
            industry, contract, or use case.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for ensuring that inputs are correct, units are
            consistent, and outputs are interpreted appropriately.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Accuracy and availability</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While care
            is taken to maintain consistency, no guarantee is made that calculators
            or content are error-free, complete, or current.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access may occasionally be interrupted due to maintenance, hosting
            limitations, or third-party service issues.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Personal responsibility and risk</h2>

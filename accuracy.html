          <p>
            SnapCalc calculators are designed for practical estimation, comparison,
            and sense-checking. Accuracy depends on correct inputs, correct units,
            and whether the calculator’s assumptions match your real-world context.
            The goal is not to provide a perfect result but to offer users a reliable
            answer based on the available data. Understanding the limits of accuracy,
            and using the results responsibly, is key to making informed decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>What “accurate” means on SnapCalc</h2>
          <p>
            A calculator can be mathematically correct and still be inappropriate
            for your situation. This typically happens when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inputs are incorrect or incomplete, leading to skewed results.</li>
            <li>Units are mixed, such as comparing monthly rates to annual ones, or mixing different units like meters and millimeters.</li>
            <li>The real-world rules differ, such as tax law, policy terms, contracts, or regulations that the calculator doesn't account for.</li>
            <li>Important context is missing, such as fees, thresholds, caps, dates, or changing rates that could affect the outcome.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common causes of misleading results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Input errors:</strong> Simple mistakes like typos, decimal errors, or incorrectly swapped fields can cause inaccurate results.</li>
            <li><strong>Unit confusion:</strong> Common unit issues like mistaking percentages for decimals, hours for minutes, or kW for W.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden constraints:</strong> Factors like minimums, maximums, and step changes in a calculation that may not be immediately obvious to the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Outdated assumptions:</strong> External factors like exchange rates, inflation rates, or legal standards that may change over time, making the results outdated.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to use results responsibly</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use outputs as a starting point for comparison and planning. While SnapCalc provides quick answers, it’s essential to understand that these are estimates.</li>
            <li>Validate results with an independent source when the decision is high-stakes, particularly for financial, legal, or regulatory purposes.</li>
            <li>Confirm that assumptions align with your specific context before relying on the output. If you’re uncertain about assumptions, review the documentation or consult a professional.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Corrections and updates</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc calculators are reviewed and updated regularly as issues are identified
            or assumptions change. We aim to maintain the accuracy of our tools, and
            any identified errors or improvements will be addressed in subsequent updates.
            If you believe a result is incorrect, we encourage you to report it so we can
            address the issue promptly. Please include the following information when reporting:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The page URL of the calculator where the error occurred.</li>
            <li>The exact inputs you used for the calculation.</li>
            <li>The expected result and your reasoning for it.</li>
            <li>The actual result shown, including any discrepancies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Related policies</h2>
          <p>
            For legal context and usage limitations, please refer to the Disclaimer and Terms pages. These provide important information about how to interpret the results, how SnapCalc operates, and any legal disclaimers associated with using the calculators.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Expanding on Assumptions</h2>
          <p>
            A key part of understanding accuracy in SnapCalc is knowing the assumptions behind each calculation. Assumptions are the starting points or defaults used by the calculator to generate results, and these can vary depending on the scenario. SnapCalc aims to clearly state all assumptions so that users know when they may need to adjust inputs or consider other factors. This includes anything from tax assumptions, inflation rates, interest rates, or even rounding conventions. It’s important to understand that assumptions can significantly impact the outcome, and where possible, we give users the flexibility to modify them. However, even with assumptions in place, the calculator can only provide estimates—real-world scenarios can differ, and external factors such as changes in tax law or interest rates can affect the result.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Ensuring Robust Data Validation</h2>
          <p>
            Accuracy is not just about getting the right inputs—it’s about ensuring that the data entered into the calculator is valid and appropriate. SnapCalc’s validation systems guard against common errors like entering non-numeric values, mismatched units, or illogical ranges. For example, if you try to enter a negative number where it doesn’t make sense, such as in the case of a loan repayment calculator where the principal can’t be negative, the system will alert you and prompt you to correct the input. These validation mechanisms are key to maintaining the integrity of the results and ensuring that users are not misled by invalid or illogical inputs.
          </p>
          
          <h2>The Role of External Factors</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc’s tools are built around broad assumptions that are applicable in most cases, but in some scenarios, external factors play a critical role. For example, an interest rate used for loan calculations may be based on an average value or a standard rate that changes over time. Similarly, tax calculations may rely on general assumptions about tax brackets or exemptions. These external factors are often out of the control of the calculator, but SnapCalc strives to make them as relevant as possible. For highly specific cases, we encourage users to consult with professionals to ensure that they are working with the most current and accurate data for their situation.

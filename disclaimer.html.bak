          <p>
            This Disclaimer applies to SnapCalc and all calculators, utilities,
            tools, pages, content, and outputs provided on this website. The site
            exists to help users estimate values, explore scenarios, and improve
            clarity when working with numbers. It is not a substitute for
            professional judgement, official sources, or regulated advice. By using SnapCalc, you agree to accept all disclaimers outlined here and acknowledge the inherent limitations of using such tools for personal, business, or professional decision-making.
          </p>

          <h2>No financial, legal, tax, investment, medical, engineering, or professional advice</h2>
          <p>
            All calculators and content on SnapCalc are provided for general
            informational and educational purposes. The website operator is not
            acting as a financial advisor, accountant, tax practitioner, attorney,
            investment consultant, medical practitioner, engineer, or licensed
            professional through the operation of this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing on SnapCalc should be interpreted as professional advice,
            recommendations, approvals, certifications, instructions, or guarantees
            for your specific situation. If you require professional advice, consult
            an appropriately qualified professional who can assess your situation
            directly and reference official sources and requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Scope of Usage:** SnapCalc is not intended for complex, high-risk, or professional-level calculations, nor is it designed to be the sole basis for significant financial, health, or legal decisions. For important matters like tax filing, legal agreements, medical treatments, or engineering projects, please consult with a certified professional.
          </p>

          <h2>General information only</h2>
          <p>
            Calculator outputs and explanatory text are designed for general reference
            and estimation. SnapCalc may use simplified assumptions, default values,
            rounding, and generic conversion factors to keep tools usable. Those
            assumptions may not reflect your jurisdiction, industry, contract terms,
            employer policies, insurance terms, local regulations, building codes,
            safety requirements, medical guidance, or other context that can materially
            change outcomes. Calculators may also be based on current average standards, which are subject to change and may not reflect future rates, fees, or laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            **No Tailored Advice:** SnapCalc is not tailored to your specific personal, business, or regional circumstances. While our calculators aim for general accuracy, users should independently verify results with authoritative, real-world sources to ensure relevance and correctness. Users are encouraged to verify assumptions or adjust them as needed for context-specific accuracy.
          </p>

          <h2>No guarantee of accuracy or suitability</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc makes no warranties regarding accuracy, completeness, suitability,
            availability, timeliness, or reliability of any calculator, output, or
            content. Results can be incorrect or misleading if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inputs are inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent</li>
            <li>Units are mixed or misunderstood</li>
            <li>Assumptions built into a tool do not match real-world conditions</li>
            <li>Rounding or approximations meaningfully affect the result</li>
            <li>External rules, rates, policies, or standards have changed</li>
            <li>Results are generated based on incomplete or outdated data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You must independently verify results before relying on them, especially
            where errors could cause financial loss, contract disputes, compliance
            issues, health impacts, safety risks, or engineering failures. SnapCalc
            assumes no responsibility for any damages arising from reliance on its outputs.
          </p>

          <h2>User responsibility for inputs and interpretation</h2>
          <p>
            You are responsible for choosing appropriate inputs, confirming values are
            correct, and interpreting outputs responsibly. SnapCalc cannot validate your
            intent or your constraints. Examples or helper text are general guidance only
            and do not reduce your obligation to verify outcomes. You should consult authoritative sources if you are unsure about any input data or result interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Accuracy and Verification:** You agree to ensure that all data input into SnapCalc’s calculators are accurate, complete, and relevant. Results produced from incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent inputs should be considered unreliable. If a result appears incorrect, treat it as unverified, cross-check with an
            independent source, and report the issue via the Contact page with the page
            URL and the input values used. You are solely responsible for how results are applied.
          </p>

          <h2>Use at your own risk</h2>
          <p>
            You use this website and its calculators at your own risk. To the maximum
            extent permitted by law, SnapCalc and the website operator are not liable
            for loss, damage, cost, injury, liability, or negative outcomes arising
            from use of or reliance on the site, its calculators, its outputs, or any
            information displayed. This includes, but is not limited to, financial losses,
            contractual issues, health issues, safety concerns, or business disruptions
            caused by incorrect or misleading results.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Limitation of Liability:** Under no circumstances will SnapCalc, its affiliates, employees, or agents be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of the site or calculators.
          </p>

          <h2>No client, advisory, or professional relationship</h2>
          <p>
            Using SnapCalc does not create a client relationship, advisory relationship,
            fiduciary relationship, or professional duty of care between you and the
            website operator. No professional services are provided through availability
            of calculators or content. SnapCalc does not take any responsibility for providing customized recommendations or advice specific to your case.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-party links, ads, and external resources</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc may contain links to third-party websites, tools, services, or
            resources. The site may also display advertising and include affiliate
            links. These are provided for convenience. SnapCalc does not control and
            is not responsible for third-party content, accuracy, availability, security,
            or privacy practices. Clicking on third-party links or interacting with
            third-party services is entirely at your own discretion, and SnapCalc is
            not responsible for any outcomes resulting from such interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Third-Party Liability:** SnapCalc disclaims all liability for any interactions with third-party services, including financial or personal data shared with external advertisers or service providers.
          </p>

            SnapCalc may update calculators, adjust formulas, improve explanations, correct
            errors, or modify site content at any time. Tools may be added, removed, or

            This Disclaimer may be updated periodically to reflect changes in site
            functionality, policies, legal requirements, or operational practices.

          <p>
            These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws applicable in the
            site operator’s jurisdiction, subject to mandatory consumer protection
            rules in your location. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be resolved in the courts of the jurisdiction where SnapCalc is based, or where applicable, international courts for cross-border cases.

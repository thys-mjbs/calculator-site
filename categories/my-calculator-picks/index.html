          <h1>My Calculator Picks</h1>
          <p>
            A small collection of tools I personally built and use.
            These aren’t exhaustive or generic — just the ones I keep coming back to.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="category-content-block category-content-primary">
          <h2>Why this category exists</h2>
        
          <p>
            This category is different from the rest of the site. It exists to house calculators that were originally built for personal use, refined through repeated real-world application, and kept because they solved problems cleanly and reliably. These tools were not designed to fill a category or cover a common use case. They were created to answer specific questions that kept recurring in daily life, planning, and decision-making, and were improved over time through actual use rather than theoretical design.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            The calculators in this category tend to be practical, opinionated, and deliberately focused. They prioritise clarity over flexibility and usefulness over completeness. Inputs are limited to what actually matters, and outputs are designed to support action rather than analysis for its own sake. In many cases, these tools reflect preferences about how information should be structured, what assumptions are reasonable, and which details are noise rather than signal.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            This category will likely remain small. Tools are added only when they earn a place through repeated use or clear personal value. The intent is not to create a comprehensive collection, but to preserve a set of calculators that have proven themselves as genuinely helpful over time. If a tool exists here, it is because it solved a real problem consistently, not because it fit neatly into an existing framework.

        <h2>How to approach and use these calculators</h2>
      
        <p>
          These calculators should be treated as working tools rather than neutral references. They reflect specific ways of thinking about problems and making trade-offs. In practice, that often means fewer inputs, stronger assumptions, and outputs that push toward clarity rather than optionality. If a result feels opinionated, that is intentional. The goal is to reduce decision fatigue by narrowing focus to what actually drives outcomes.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Because these tools were built around real usage, they tend to favour repeatability. They are designed to be revisited frequently, adjusted incrementally, and used as part of an ongoing process rather than a one-off calculation. For example, a budgeting or tracking tool in this category is meant to be checked, updated, and reacted to regularly, not completed once and archived.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          These calculators are also allowed to evolve. As needs change, assumptions may be refined, logic adjusted, or outputs reframed. That flexibility is part of the purpose of keeping them separate from the more standardised categories on the site. They are not meant to be universal. They are meant to be useful.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          If you find a calculator here that aligns with how you think or plan, it is likely because the underlying problem is shared, even if the framing is personal. Use the outputs as prompts for action and reflection rather than definitive answers. The value of this category lies in practicality, not coverage.

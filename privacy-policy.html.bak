          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how SnapCalc collects, uses, stores, and
            protects information when you visit or interact with this website. The
            goal is to be clear about what information is involved, why it is used,
            and what choices are available to you. Transparency and user privacy are of the utmost importance to us, and we are committed to ensuring that your experience with SnapCalc remains secure and respectful of your personal information.
          </p>

          <p>
            SnapCalc is designed to work without accounts or logins. Most visitors can
            use calculators, utilities, and informational pages without submitting
            personal details. By using this site, you agree to the practices described
            in this policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that any data you provide is handled securely.
          </p>

          <h2>Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc does not collect personal information by default. You are not
            required to register or provide identifying details to use the tools on
            this site. This ensures that your experience remains hassle-free and focused on providing you with the tools you need without unnecessary barriers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal information is collected only when you choose to provide it,
            such as when submitting a message through the contact form. This may
            include your email address and the contents of your message, and is used
            solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not use your contact information for any other purposes unless explicitly stated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain non-personal information may be collected automatically through
            standard web technologies. This can include browser type, operating
            system, device category, approximate location, IP address, pages visited,
            referral sources, and interaction patterns. This data does not directly
            identify you and is used to enhance user experience, improve site functionality, and for analytics purposes.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc may use cookies and similar technologies to support core site
            functionality, measure usage patterns, and display advertising. Cookies
            are small text files stored on your device that help the site understand
            how it is used. These cookies are essential for ensuring that the site functions correctly, such as remembering user settings or keeping track of calculator inputs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third-party services, including analytics providers and advertising
            networks such as Google AdSense, may also use cookies or similar
            identifiers. These are governed by the privacy policies of those third
            parties. We have no control over the data they collect, and we recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party providers for more information.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. Note
            that disabling cookies may affect how certain features function, such as preferences or login details. If you do so, some parts of the site may not work as expected.
          </p>

            such as hosting, analytics, or advertising services, and only as needed
            for those services to function. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the specific purpose of supporting SnapCalc's functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Information may also be disclosed if required by law or necessary to

          </p>

            communication record. Non-personal analytics data is retained according
            to the policies of the relevant service providers, and we only retain the data we need for analytical purposes.

          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how SnapCalc collects, uses, stores, and
            protects information when you visit or interact with this website. The
            goal is to be clear about what information is involved, why it is used,
            and what choices are available to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            SnapCalc is designed to work without accounts or logins. Most visitors can
            use calculators, utilities, and informational pages without submitting
            personal details. By using this site, you agree to the practices described
            in this policy.
          </p>

          <h2>Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc does not collect personal information by default. You are not
            required to register or provide identifying details to use the tools on
            this site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal information is collected only when you choose to provide it,
            such as when submitting a message through the contact form. This may
            include your email address and the contents of your message, and is used
            solely to respond to your inquiry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain non-personal information may be collected automatically through
            standard web technologies. This can include browser type, operating
            system, device category, approximate location, IP address, pages visited,
            referral sources, and interaction patterns. This data does not directly
            identify you.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc may use cookies and similar technologies to support core site
            functionality, measure usage patterns, and display advertising. Cookies
            are small text files stored on your device that help the site understand
            how it is used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third-party services, including analytics providers and advertising
            networks such as Google AdSense, may also use cookies or similar
            identifiers. These are governed by the privacy policies of those third
            parties.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. Note
            that disabling cookies may affect how certain features function.

          </p>

          <p>
            Information may also be disclosed if required by law or necessary to

            Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights related to personal
            data, such as requesting access, correction, or deletion of information
            you have provided. Requests can be submitted through the contact page and
            may require verification.

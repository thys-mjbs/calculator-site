                This Privacy Policy explains in detail how SnapCalc collects, uses,
                stores, and protects information when you visit or interact with this
                website. The purpose of this policy is to provide clear, transparent
                information about data handling practices so that users can understand
                what information is involved, why it is used, and what choices are
                available.
              </p>

              <p>
                SnapCalc is designed to be usable without creating an account or
                providing personal details. Most visitors can access calculators,
                utilities, and informational pages without submitting any identifying
                information. By using this website, you acknowledge and agree to the
                practices described in this Privacy Policy.
              </p>

              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc does not collect personal information by default. You are not
                required to register, log in, or provide identifying details in order
                to use the calculators and tools available on this site.
              </p>

              <p>
                Personal information is collected only when you voluntarily choose to
                provide it. This typically occurs when you submit a message through the
                contact form. In those cases, the information you provide may include
                your email address and the contents of your message. This information
                is used solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to voluntary submissions, certain non-personal information
                may be collected automatically through standard web technologies. This
                can include your browser type, operating system, device category,
                approximate geographic location, IP address, pages visited, referral
                sources, and interaction patterns. This data does not directly identify
                you as an individual.
              </p>

              <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may use cookies and similar technologies to support core
                website functionality, measure usage patterns, and display advertising.
                Cookies are small text files stored on your device that allow the site
                to recognize repeat visits and understand how pages are used.
              </p>

              <p>
                Third-party services integrated into this site, including analytics
                providers and advertising networks such as Google AdSense, may also
                place cookies or use similar identifiers. These technologies help
                deliver relevant advertisements, prevent fraud, and generate aggregate
                reporting on site usage.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. Be
                aware that disabling cookies may affect certain features or limit how
                effectively the site functions.
              </p>

              <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
              <p>

              <ul>
                <li>Maintaining and improving calculator accuracy and usability</li>

                <li>Displaying advertising and affiliate content where applicable</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                No collected information is used for profiling individuals, automated
                decision-making, or purposes unrelated to the operation of the site.
              </p>

              <h2>Advertising and Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may display advertising through third-party networks, including
                Google AdSense, as well as affiliate links to external products or
                services. These third parties may use cookies or similar technologies
                to measure ad performance and display ads that are relevant to users.
              </p>

              <p>
                SnapCalc does not receive access to personal profiles created by
                advertisers, and any data collected by advertising partners is governed
                by their own privacy policies. Users are encouraged to review the
                privacy policies of those third parties for additional details.
              </p>

              <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc does not sell, rent, or trade personal information. Information
                may be shared only with service providers that support the operation of
                the site, such as hosting services, analytics platforms, and advertising
                networks, and only to the extent necessary for those services to
                function.
              </p>

              <p>
                Information may also be disclosed if required by law, regulation, or
                legal process, or if necessary to protect the rights, safety, or
                integrity of the website and its users.
              </p>

              <h2>Data Retention</h2>
              <p>
                Personal information submitted through the contact form is retained
                only for as long as necessary to address the inquiry or maintain a
                reasonable communication record. Non-personal analytics data is
                retained according to the policies of the respective analytics or
                service providers.

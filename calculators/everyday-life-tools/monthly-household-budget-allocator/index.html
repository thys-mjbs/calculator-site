              <h2>Monthly household budget allocator for a realistic spending plan</h2>

              <p>A monthly budget allocator turns one number (your take-home income) into a usable plan: how much you can safely spend on essentials, how much room you have for discretionary spending, and how much you should set aside for savings. Most people do not struggle because they cannot do the math. They struggle because they do not translate income into clear caps that match real life. This calculator is designed to produce those caps fast.</p>

              <p>The intent of this page is simple: build a workable monthly household budget from your take-home income. It is not a debt payoff optimizer, an investment planner, or a cash-flow forecast for a business. It is a household budgeting tool that gives you category limits you can actually follow. If you already know some fixed monthly costs like rent, utilities, debt payments, and insurance, you can include them and the calculator will allocate what is left.</p>

              <p>How to use it: enter your monthly take-home income first. Then add any fixed monthly bills you already know. Fixed costs are the items that stay roughly the same each month and are hard to cut quickly. When you calculate, the tool subtracts your fixed costs and then allocates your remaining money into a practical split for groceries, transport, household essentials, discretionary spending, savings, and a small buffer for unexpected expenses. You also get weekly targets so you can pace spending through the month.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Income is your take-home amount after tax and payroll deductions, not your gross salary.</li>
                <li>Fixed costs are treated as first priority and are subtracted before any category caps are set.</li>
                <li>If you do not enter optional fixed costs, the calculator assumes they are zero and allocates based on income alone.</li>
                <li>The default split applies to the remaining money after fixed costs: 25% groceries, 15% transport, 10% household essentials, 25% discretionary, 20% savings, 5% buffer.</li>
                <li>If you use the Advanced percentage fields, they must add up to 100% and they only affect the remaining money, not your fixed costs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Why does this calculator ask for take-home income instead of gross income?</h3>
              <p>Your household budget is paid with money that actually lands in your account. Gross income can be useful for tax planning, but it is not the number that determines whether you can pay rent and buy groceries. Using take-home income makes the spending caps realistic from day one.</p>

              <h3>What if my fixed costs are higher than my income?</h3>
              <p>If your fixed costs exceed your take-home income, you are running a structural deficit and the calculator will stop with a clear warning. In that situation, category caps do not solve the problem. You need to reduce fixed commitments, increase income, or use short-term bridging with a plan to exit it. This tool is built to highlight that issue immediately instead of hiding it.</p>

              <h3>Are the default percentages “correct” for everyone?</h3>
              <p>No. They are a practical baseline for many households, not a universal rule. The default split is designed to be usable without forcing you to guess everything. If your reality is different, use the Advanced section to apply your own split. The value of the calculator is the structure: fixed costs first, then clear caps for what remains.</p>

              <h3>Should savings still get money if I have debt?</h3>
              <p>For most households, yes. A small buffer and some savings reduce the chance that a single unexpected bill pushes you back into debt. That said, if you are focused on aggressive debt payoff, you can reduce the savings percentage and increase the discretionary or essentials caps, or treat extra debt payments as part of your fixed costs.</p>

              <h3>How can I make the result more accurate for my household?</h3>
              <p>Add the fixed costs you know, even if they are estimates. Rent or mortgage is the biggest one. If your fixed costs include subscriptions, school fees, medical contributions, or childcare, put them into “Other fixed monthly costs.” The more of your true fixed baseline you include, the more meaningful the remaining category caps become.</p>

              <h2>Tip calculator to split your restaurant bill fairly</h2>
              <p>
                This tip calculator helps you work out how much to tip on a restaurant or bar bill and how much each person should pay.
                Enter the total bill, choose a tip percentage, and add how many people are sharing. The calculator returns the tip amount,
                the new total bill including tip, and a per person split.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tool is useful when you are at a table with friends, family, or colleagues and want a quick, fair way to divide the cost.
                It avoids mental arithmetic at the table and reduces arguments about who should pay what.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can adjust the tip percentage to match local customs, service quality, or your own preference.
                If you want one person to pay more than others, you can still use this calculator as a baseline and then adjust manually.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The bill amount is the full amount charged by the restaurant, including tax or VAT.</li>
                <li>The tip percentage applies to the full bill amount, not per person.</li>
                <li>The number of people is a positive whole number and everyone pays the same amount.</li>
                <li>The calculator does not handle different shares or discounts for specific people.</li>
                <li>All results are rounded to two decimal places for clarity on typical card or cash payments.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To use the calculator, start by entering the bill amount as it appears on the slip. Then choose a tip percentage that feels
                appropriate for the service. Finally, enter the number of people who will share the bill. Click the calculate button to see
                the tip amount, the total to pay including tip, and how that breaks down per person.
              </p>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What tip percentage should I use?</h3>
              <p>
                This depends on local customs and service quality. In many places, 10 percent is a basic tip, 12.5 to 15 percent is common for
                good service, and higher percentages are used for exceptional service. If you are unsure, start with 10 to 12.5 percent.
              </p>

              <h3>Should I tip on the total bill including tax?</h3>
              <p>
                The calculator assumes that you tip on the full bill amount, including tax or VAT. Some people prefer to tip only on the
                pre-tax amount. If you want to do that, enter the pre-tax amount instead of the full total.
              </p>

              <h3>How do I handle someone who wants to pay more or less?</h3>
              <p>
                This tool splits the total evenly across everyone. If one person wants to pay more or less, you can still use the per person
                figure as a starting point and then adjust manually. For example, one person can pay a little more to cover drinks or starter dishes.
              </p>

              <h3>Can I use this calculator for delivery orders or takeaways?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes. The calculator works for any situation where you want to add a tip to a bill and possibly split it between people.
                This includes food delivery, takeaway orders, and in person meals.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the people count need to be a whole number?</h3>
              <p>
                In most real situations you are splitting the bill between a fixed number of people. Using a whole number keeps the split simple.
                If you need a more complex split, you can still use the total with tip output and then divide it manually according to your own rules.
              </p>

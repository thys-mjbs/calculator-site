<h2>Assignment weighting calculator for weighted grades and target results</h2>
<p>Not all assignments count the same. A 10% quiz and a 40% final exam can have very different impact on your final mark, even if the raw scores look similar. This assignment weighting calculator helps you convert a list of weighted course items into a clear picture of where you stand right now and what you need next.</p>
<p>You can use it in two ways. For a quick answer, enter the weight and score for the assignments you have completed and leave future items blank. The calculator will show your current weighted average based on graded work and how much weight is still ungraded. For a more accurate plan, enter weights for all known course items (including exams, projects, and participation) and then add scores as you receive them. The remaining weight and “required score to hit target” become far more reliable when your total planned weight is close to 100%.</p>
<p>Unlike a simple average, a weighted grade is built from each item’s contribution to the final mark. If an assignment is worth 20% and you score 80, that item contributes 16 points toward a 100-point final. Add up those contributions, then divide by the weight covered so far to get your current average for completed work. The calculator also estimates what your final grade would be if you perform on the remaining work at the same average you have achieved so far. That gives you a quick reality check without forcing you to guess future scores.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weights are percentages of the final grade. If your syllabus uses points, convert them to percentages first (item points ÷ total points × 100).</li>
<li>Scores should be entered on the selected scale (0–100 or 0–4.0). Keep weights the same regardless of the scale.</li>
<li>Only rows with a valid weight are counted. A row with a score but no weight is ignored because it has no defined impact.</li>
<li>If you leave a score blank, the calculator treats that item as not yet graded and includes its weight in “remaining weight” if a weight is present.</li>
<li>Required scores are averages across the remaining weighted items. If you have multiple future items, you can meet the requirement with different combinations as long as the weighted average matches.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>What if my weights do not add up to 100%?</h3>
<p>You can still calculate a current weighted average for completed work. The “remaining weight” will reflect the difference between your total planned weight and the weight that already has a score. If your total planned weight is far from 100%, treat the required score and projections as provisional until you know the full breakdown.</p>
<h3>Should I enter items that are not graded yet?</h3>
<p>Yes, if you know their weights. That improves the accuracy of the “remaining weight” and the required score to hit your target. If you do not know the weight yet, leave that row blank and use the calculator to understand your current position only.</p>
<h3>What does “required score on remaining work” actually mean?</h3>
<p>It is the average score you must achieve across all ungraded items, weighted by their percentages, to reach your target final grade. It is not a promise about a single exam score unless all remaining weight is in one item.</p>
<h3>Why does my current average change when I add more weights without scores?</h3>
<p>Your current average for completed work should not change just because you list future items. If you see a change, it typically means a weight or score was entered in a way that made an item count as graded or ungraded differently. Double-check for accidental values like “0” scores or missing weights.</p>
<h3>Can this calculator work for GPA instead of percentages?</h3>
<p>Yes. Switch the grade scale to 0–4.0 and enter your scores as GPA values. The calculator still uses weights as percentages, and it will output your current weighted GPA and the required GPA on remaining items to hit a target GPA.</p>
<h3>How can I make the result more accurate?</h3>
<p>Use the exact weights from your syllabus, include all known items so the total planned weight is close to 100%, and enter scores on the correct scale. If your course drops the lowest score or uses special rules, account for that by excluding dropped items or adjusting weights to match the rule.</p>

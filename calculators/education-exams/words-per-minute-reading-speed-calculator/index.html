<h2>Words per minute reading speed calculator for study and exam planning</h2>
<p>
                This calculator measures your reading speed in words per minute (WPM) using one simple idea:
                divide the number of words you read by the time it took you to read them. Knowing your WPM is
                useful when you are planning study sessions, estimating how long a chapter will take, or setting
                realistic targets for timed reading tasks. Instead of guessing, you can use your own numbers and
                get a clear baseline.
              </p>
<p>
                To use it, count the words you read (or use the word count from the document you read), then
                enter the minutes and optional seconds it took you to finish that section. The calculator returns
                your raw WPM first. Raw WPM is the speed of your eyes moving through the text, regardless of how
                well you understood it. That is often fine for light reading, but it can be misleading for studying.
              </p>
<p>
                For learning and exams, comprehension matters. That is why this calculator also lets you add an
                optional comprehension score from 0% to 100%. If you score yourself at 80%, the calculator will
                estimate an “effective WPM” by multiplying your raw WPM by 0.80. Effective WPM is not a perfect
                scientific measure, but it is a practical way to link speed to understanding. The result area also
                provides time estimates for common reading lengths, so you can quickly translate WPM into actual
                planning decisions.
              </p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>
                  Word count should match what you actually read. Skipping headings, tables, or examples reduces the
                  true word count and inflates WPM.
                </li>
<li>
                  Time should be “active reading time.” If you paused for a message or got distracted, the WPM will
                  drop and the estimate will reflect that.
                </li>
<li>
                  Seconds are optional. If you only know minutes, leave seconds blank and the calculator will assume 0.
                </li>
<li>
                  Comprehension is optional and defaults to 100%. If you provide a score, effective WPM is calculated as
                  raw WPM × (comprehension ÷ 100).
                </li>
<li>
                  The time estimates use a simple conversion from your effective WPM. They are planning aids, not guarantees,
                  because text difficulty and fatigue change over time.
                </li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>What is a “good” WPM reading speed?</h3>
<p>
                It depends on your goal and the difficulty of the material. Many adults read general text somewhere around
                the low hundreds of WPM, while careful study reading can be slower. Use this calculator to track your own
                baseline and compare changes over time, rather than chasing a single number.
              </p>
<h3>Why does my WPM change so much between texts?</h3>
<p>
                Difficulty, vocabulary, formatting, and purpose all change speed. Dense textbooks and technical documents
                usually reduce WPM. Skimmable articles can increase it. If you want stable tracking, test yourself using
                similar types of material each time.
              </p>
<h3>Should I use raw WPM or effective WPM for study planning?</h3>
<p>
                For studying, effective WPM is usually the better planning number because it accounts for understanding.
                If you read quickly but retain little, raw WPM will overestimate how much you can learn in a session.
                If you do not have a clear comprehension score, keep it at 100% and treat the estimates as optimistic.
              </p>
<h3>What if I do not know the word count?</h3>
<p>
                The most accurate approach is to use a word count from your document or a digital reader. If you only have
                pages, you can approximate by checking how many words are on a typical page of that material, then multiply.
                The calculator is designed around words because pages vary widely by font size, margins, and formatting.
              </p>
<h3>How can I improve the accuracy of my reading speed measurement?</h3>
<p>
                Use a consistent test length (for example 700 to 1,200 words), time yourself without interruptions, and
                measure comprehension with a quick self-check such as a short summary or a few questions. Repeating this
                once a week gives you a reliable trend line, which is more useful than a single best attempt.

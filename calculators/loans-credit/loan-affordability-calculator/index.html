              <h2>Loan affordability calculator for maximum loan amount and budget checks</h2>

              <p>A loan affordability calculator helps you estimate how much you can borrow without guessing. Instead of starting with the bank’s headline limit, you start with your own cash flow. You enter your monthly net income, your essential expenses, and any existing debt payments. From that, the calculator estimates a practical monthly payment limit for a new loan and then converts that payment into a maximum loan amount using the interest rate and loan term you choose.</p>

              <p>This is useful because the same loan amount can feel easy or impossible depending on the interest rate and repayment period. A higher interest rate increases the monthly payment and total interest paid. A longer term usually reduces the monthly payment, but it increases the total cost over time because you pay interest for longer. Affordability is therefore not just about the loan amount. It is about the payment and how that payment fits into a realistic monthly budget.</p>

              <p>This calculator offers two practical views. First, it can estimate the maximum loan you can afford given a payment limit derived from your budget. Second, it can check a specific loan amount and tell you what the monthly payment would be and whether it fits within your estimated payment limit. If you are shopping around, use the check mode to test different interest rates and terms. If you are planning and want a safe starting point, use the maximum loan mode.</p>

              <p>The core math behind the result is the standard amortization formula used for most installment loans. It assumes fixed monthly payments over the term with interest compounded monthly. If your real loan has fees, insurance, balloon payments, or a variable rate, the real payment can differ. The calculator is still valuable because it gives you a baseline that you can sanity check against quotes.</p>

              <p>For best results, treat the payment limit as a deliberate decision, not a target to maximize. Many people can technically spend more on debt, but doing so creates risk. Income can vary, expenses can spike, and interest rates can change if your loan is variable. A smaller payment that you can comfortably handle provides a buffer for real life.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Income is monthly net income (after tax) unless you intentionally want to model gross income.</li>
                <li>Essential expenses should include unavoidable costs that must be paid every month.</li>
                <li>Existing debt payments should include minimum payments you are already committed to.</li>
                <li>The target percentage applies to your remaining budget after expenses and existing debt, not to your full income.</li>
                <li>The calculation assumes a fixed interest rate, fixed monthly payments, and no extra fees or insurance.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What does “target % of remaining budget” mean?</h3>
              <p>It is a control that limits how much of your leftover monthly cash flow you want to allocate to the new loan. The calculator first estimates your remaining budget as income minus expenses minus existing debt payments. Then it applies your chosen percentage to that amount. For example, if you have 10,000 remaining and you choose 30%, the estimated payment limit becomes 3,000 per month.</p>

              <h3>What is a reasonable percentage to use?</h3>
              <p>There is no universal number because budgets vary, but lower is safer. If you want a conservative estimate, use 20% to 30% of your remaining budget. If your income is stable and you have a strong emergency fund, you might choose a higher percentage. If your income varies, you should choose a lower percentage and keep a buffer.</p>

              <h3>Why does a longer term increase total interest?</h3>
              <p>A longer term spreads payments over more months, so the balance stays outstanding for longer. Even if the monthly payment drops, the total interest paid across the full repayment period often increases. That is the trade off between monthly affordability and total cost.</p>

              <h3>How do I use this to compare offers from lenders?</h3>
              <p>Use the “check” mode and enter the loan amount you want to borrow. Then test different interest rates and terms from lender quotes. Compare the monthly payment and the total interest. If one offer has a lower rate but higher fees, the calculator will not include the fees, so use it for the payment baseline and then factor fees into your decision separately.</p>

              <h3>Does this include fees, initiation charges, or insurance?</h3>
              <p>No. This calculator focuses on the principal and interest repayment. Many real loans include initiation fees, service fees, credit life insurance, or other charges. Those costs can increase your monthly payment. If you want a more conservative estimate, reduce your payment percentage or increase your expenses to simulate extra monthly charges.</p>

              <h2>Credit utilization calculator for credit cards</h2>

              <p>Credit utilization is one of the simplest credit metrics to measure and one of the easiest to accidentally push into a risky range. It is the percentage of your available revolving credit that you are currently using. For most people, this means credit card balances compared to total credit card limits. Even if you pay your card in full every month, the balance that gets reported at statement time can still create a high utilization snapshot.</p>

              <p>This credit utilization calculator helps you compute your current utilization rate, your remaining available credit, and a practical paydown target. If you provide a target utilization percentage, the calculator also estimates how much you would need to pay down (or how much extra you could spend) to land at that target. It is designed for quick use with just two numbers, but it also supports a more deliberate workflow if you want to manage utilization proactively.</p>

              <p>To use it, enter your total credit limit across all cards and your total current balances across those cards. If you only want a quick answer, leave the target field blank and you will still get your utilization rate plus a short interpretation. If you want a planning number, set a target utilization (many people aim for 30% or lower, and some aim for 10% or lower) and the calculator will show a concrete paydown amount and a spending headroom amount at that target.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This calculator uses total revolving limits and balances (typically credit cards). It is not designed for installment loans like car finance or personal loans.</li>
                <li>Utilization is calculated as balance ÷ limit. If your balance is higher than your limit, utilization can exceed 100% and is treated as high risk.</li>
                <li>If you leave the target utilization blank, the calculator assumes a default target of 30% for the planning outputs.</li>
                <li>Balances can change daily and reporting dates differ by issuer. Use your most recent balances or statement balances for the most realistic snapshot.</li>
                <li>Results are guidance for planning and monitoring. Credit scoring models vary, and utilization is only one factor among many.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is credit utilization, in plain language?</h3>
              <p>It is how much of your available credit you are currently using. If you have a total limit of 10,000 and a total balance of 2,500, your utilization is 25%. Lower utilization generally indicates more unused credit capacity, which is typically viewed as lower risk.</p>

              <h3>Do I need to calculate utilization per card or in total?</h3>
              <p>Both can matter. Total utilization across all cards is a key metric, but high utilization on a single card can still be a red flag even if your overall utilization looks fine. This calculator uses totals because it is the most common and most practical first check. If you want per card, run the calculator again per card and compare the results.</p>

              <h3>Why does my utilization look high even though I pay in full?</h3>
              <p>Because issuers often report the balance on your statement date, not after you pay. If you spend heavily during the month and pay after the statement closes, the reported balance can be high. To reduce the reported utilization snapshot, you can make an earlier payment before the statement date or split payments during the month.</p>

              <h3>What target utilization should I use?</h3>
              <p>If you need a simple benchmark, 30% is widely used as a practical ceiling for “reasonable” utilization. If you are optimizing for stronger credit signals, some people target under 10%. Your best target depends on what you are trying to achieve and whether paying down earlier creates cash flow pressure.</p>

              <h3>What if my total balance is higher than my total limit?</h3>
              <p>The calculator will show utilization above 100%. This can happen with fees, interest, or temporary over-limit situations. Treat it as a high-risk signal and focus on reducing balances quickly. If you believe the limit is incorrect, confirm current limits across cards because issuers sometimes reduce limits without much notice.</p>

              <h2>Ride-share cost split calculator for Uber, Bolt, taxis, and shared lifts</h2>

              <p>This ride-share cost split calculator helps you divide the total cost of a single ride between the people in the car. The main use case is simple: one person paid in the app, and everyone else needs to reimburse them fairly. You enter the base fare shown by the ride-share app, choose how many people are splitting, and you get a clear per-person amount.</p>

              <p>Real rides often have more than just the fare. There may be tolls, a booking fee, parking charges, or other extras that get added to the trip total. Sometimes there is a promo code or discount. And in many groups, someone adds a tip. This calculator supports those real-world adjustments without turning the tool into a complicated budgeting app.</p>

              <p>The output is designed for one decision: “What should each person pay for this ride?” You will see the final trip total used for the split, the per-person share, and (if you enable it) a rounded per-person amount to make it easier to pay using cash or quick transfers. If rounding changes the total collected, the calculator also shows the small difference so you can avoid shortfalls or awkward back-and-forth.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This calculator is for splitting one ride’s total cost equally between people. It does not allocate costs by distance, time in the car, or separate pickup/drop-off legs.</li>
                <li>“Base fare” should match what the app shows as the trip price before you manually add extras. If your app total already includes fees, you can leave “Extra fees” as zero.</li>
                <li>Discounts are treated as a currency amount and reduce the total before splitting. If you only know a percentage discount, convert it to an amount first using the final app total.</li>
                <li>If you enter a tip amount, it overrides the tip percentage. Use one or the other to avoid double counting.</li>
                <li>Rounding is applied per person, not to the total. If you choose “Always round up,” the group will collect slightly more than the exact total, which is useful when you want to ensure the payer is not short.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What number should I use as the base fare?</h3>
              <p>Use the price shown for the trip in the ride-share app (or on the receipt) before you add your own manual adjustments. If the receipt already includes tolls or booking fees in the total, you can still use that as the base fare and leave “Extra fees” as zero. The goal is to represent the ride total once, not twice.</p>

              <h3>Should I split the tip as well?</h3>
              <p>Only if your group agrees the tip is shared. Many groups split the whole total including tip because everyone benefited from the ride. If the tip was a personal choice by the payer, set tip to zero and split only the ride and fees. The calculator supports both approaches, but it will not decide for you.</p>

              <h3>What if someone is not paying or joined late?</h3>
              <p>This calculator assumes equal split between the number of people you enter. If one person is not paying, reduce the “Number of people splitting” to count only payers. If someone joined late or left early, this tool is not the right fit because it does not allocate by time or distance. Use a negotiated split instead of pretending it is “equal.”</p>

              <h3>Why does rounding change the total collected?</h3>
              <p>Rounding is applied to each person’s share. When you round each share, the sum of the rounded amounts can be slightly higher or lower than the exact total. This is normal. If you choose “Always round up,” the result will usually be higher, which avoids the payer being short. If you choose “Nearest,” the difference could be small in either direction.</p>

              <h3>How can I make the result more accurate?</h3>
              <p>Use the final receipt amount and include any extras that were charged outside the base fare (tolls, parking, or manual add-ons). If there is a discount, enter it as a currency amount. For tips, prefer the actual tip amount if you know it. Accuracy is mostly about using the right total, not adding more fields.</p>

              <h2>Calculate your ETA from departure time, distance, and average speed</h2>

              <p>
                This ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) calculator helps you answer one practical question: if you leave at a specific time and travel a known distance at a roughly steady average speed, what time will you arrive? That is the common planning problem for road trips, deliveries, school runs, airport pickups, and any situation where you need a realistic arrival time for a single trip.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use it, enter your departure date and time, your trip distance, and your average speed. If you want a more realistic estimate, add the total time you expect to spend stopped (fuel, food, rest breaks) and optionally add a delay percentage to cover traffic, roadworks, or slow sections. The calculator combines these inputs into a total travel duration and then adds that duration to your departure time to produce an estimated arrival time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The results are designed to be usable immediately. You will see your ETA as a full date and time (useful for longer trips that cross midnight), plus the total trip duration in hours and minutes. You will also see a short breakdown so you can understand what is driving the estimate: the driving time based on distance and speed, the time added for stops, and any delay factor applied to the driving time.
              </p>

              <p>
                This page is intentionally focused on a single decision: estimating arrival time for one trip using average speed. It does not try to do route planning, multi-stop navigation, public transport schedules, or fuel cost calculations. If you need those, you need a mapping or routing tool. This calculator is for quick, transparent ETA math when you already know the approximate distance and the pace you expect to maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Average speed is the key input. Most people overestimate average speed by thinking in terms of top speed rather than what happens over the whole trip. If you drive at 120 km/h on a highway but spend time in towns, at lights, or behind slower traffic, your true average is often much lower. Using a realistic average speed produces a much better ETA than using the maximum speed you might reach briefly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The optional delay percentage is a simple way to add realism without forcing you to guess every detail. For example, adding 10% to the driving time can approximate moderate congestion or slower-than-expected conditions. Stops are treated separately because they are time you know you will spend not moving. This separation makes it easier to adjust the estimate: if you change your stop plan, you can update just the stop minutes without changing your speed assumptions.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Your distance and speed are meant to describe the same trip segment, not a mix of unrelated legs.</li>
                <li>Average speed is the whole-trip average (including slow sections), not your maximum or cruising speed.</li>
                <li>Delay percent is applied to driving time only, and stops are added afterward as a fixed number of minutes.</li>
                <li>Departure time is interpreted in your device’s local time zone, and the ETA is displayed in the same zone.</li>
                <li>This is a single-trip estimate and does not account for route changes, scheduled events, ferries, or border delays.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What format should I use for the departure time?</h3>
              <p>
                Use the format shown in the field label: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, for example 2025-12-30 14:30. If you paste a value like 2025-12-30T14:30, the calculator will still try to interpret it correctly. If the date or time cannot be parsed reliably, you will see an error asking you to correct the format.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does my ETA look too optimistic?</h3>
              <p>
                Most optimistic ETAs come from an unrealistic average speed. If you enter a high speed that you only reach occasionally, the estimate will be too short. Reduce the average speed to something you can sustain across the whole trip, then add stops and a small delay percentage for conditions you expect.
              </p>

              <h3>Should I choose km and km/h or miles and mph?</h3>
              <p>
                Use whatever you naturally think in. The calculator will convert internally so the math stays consistent. The important part is that distance and speed represent the same measurement system. If you enter miles and km/h (or km and mph), the calculator converts the speed to match the distance unit before calculating time.
              </p>

              <h3>What does “delay percent” actually do?</h3>
              <p>
                It increases the driving time by a percentage. For example, if your driving time is 2 hours and you set delay to 15%, the driving portion becomes 2 hours and 18 minutes. Stops are then added on top of that. This is a simple way to add a buffer when you expect traffic, rain, heavy vehicles, or other slowdowns.
              </p>

              <h3>What if my trip crosses midnight or takes more than one day?</h3>
              <p>
                The calculator adds the total travel time to the departure date and time, so it naturally rolls over to the next day (or later) when needed. This is why the result shows a full date and time instead of only a clock time.
              </p>

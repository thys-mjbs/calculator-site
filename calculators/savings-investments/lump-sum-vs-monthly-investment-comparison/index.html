<h2>Lump sum vs monthly investing calculator</h2>
<p>This calculator compares two common ways people invest: putting a single amount in upfront (a lump sum) or investing smaller amounts each month (monthly contributions). Both approaches can be sensible. The right answer depends on your time horizon, expected returns, and what you can realistically afford. Instead of debating opinions, this calculator shows the numbers under one consistent set of assumptions.</p>
<p>To use it, enter your lump sum amount and your monthly contribution amount, then set your time horizon in years and an expected annual return. If you pay an annual platform or fund fee, include it as a percentage. If you want a rough “today’s money” view, add an inflation rate. Finally, choose whether your monthly deposits happen at the end of the month (typical for salary-based investing) or at the start of the month (slightly more optimistic because money is invested sooner).</p>
<p>The results are designed to be decision-friendly. You will see the future value of the lump sum strategy and the future value of the monthly contribution strategy over the same period. You will also see the total amount you actually contributed under the monthly plan, the estimated investment growth (future value minus contributions), and the difference between the two strategies. If you include inflation, the calculator also shows inflation-adjusted (real) values so you can judge purchasing power, not just nominal balances.</p>
<p>How the math works is straightforward. The calculator converts the annual return (and any annual fee) into a monthly growth rate. The lump sum grows by compounding for the full number of months. The monthly contributions grow as a series of deposits, where each deposit compounds for the remaining months after it is made. If deposits are at the end of each month, the contributions compound slightly less than if deposits are at the start of each month. When inflation is included, the calculator discounts the nominal future values back into today’s money using your inflation rate across the same time horizon.</p>
<p>One extra output that helps in real life is the break-even monthly amount. This answers a practical question: if you have a lump sum available, what monthly contribution would end with roughly the same future value over the same period (given the same assumptions)? This is useful for trade-offs such as investing a bonus now versus increasing a debit order for the next few years.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Returns are assumed to be smooth and compounded monthly. Real markets move unevenly, so this is a planning estimate.</li>
<li>Fees are treated as an annual drag on growth. Actual fee structures vary (platform, fund, advice, transaction costs).</li>
<li>Monthly contributions are assumed to be equal every month and made either at month-end or month-start (you choose).</li>
<li>Inflation adjustment is optional and uses a single constant rate to convert future values into approximate “today’s money.”</li>
<li>Taxes are not modeled. If your account is taxable, after-tax outcomes can differ materially from these estimates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>Is a lump sum always better than monthly investing?</h3>
<p>No. A lump sum has more time in the market, so under a positive return assumption it often ends higher. But monthly investing can be better for cash flow reality, risk comfort, and situations where the lump sum is not actually available. The calculator shows the difference under your assumptions, not a universal rule.</p>
<h3>What should I use for “expected annual return”?</h3>
<p>Use a conservative long-term estimate that matches what you are investing in. If you do not know, start with a range and test sensitivity (for example 5%, 8%, and 10%). If small changes in return flip the outcome, treat the decision as uncertain and focus on what you can control: contribution rate, fees, and time.</p>
<h3>Why does “start of month” change the result?</h3>
<p>If you invest at the start of the month, each deposit has one extra month to compound compared to investing at month-end. Over many months, that extra compounding adds up. Month-end is the more common real-world assumption for salary-based investing, but start-of-month can approximate automated investing right after you get paid.</p>
<h3>How do fees affect the comparison?</h3>
<p>Fees reduce the compounding rate, which has an outsized impact over long horizons. If you are comparing strategies over 10 to 30 years, even small fee differences can outweigh the choice between lump sum and monthly investing. Use the fee field to stress-test the impact and avoid being fooled by optimistic gross return numbers.</p>
<h3>What does “break-even monthly amount” mean, and how should I use it?</h3>
<p>It is the monthly contribution that would roughly match the lump sum’s future value over the same horizon and assumptions. Use it for budgeting decisions: if the break-even monthly amount is higher than you can sustain, the lump sum is likely the more powerful lever. If it is affordable, consistent monthly investing may be enough to reach the same target without relying on a large upfront amount.</p>

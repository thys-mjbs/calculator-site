              <h2>Real hourly wage calculator to compare jobs on a true per-hour basis</h2>

              <p>Your advertised hourly rate or salary is rarely your real hourly pay. Many jobs include unpaid time that still belongs to work, such as commuting, unpaid overtime, and unpaid breaks. On top of that, some roles require regular out-of-pocket costs such as transport, parking, meals, uniforms, tools, or data. This calculator estimates your real hourly wage by spreading your net income across all the time and costs that the job actually requires.</p>

              <p>Use it when you are comparing two job offers, considering a change in commute, deciding whether overtime is worth it, or trying to understand why a higher salary does not feel meaningfully better. The goal is not to produce a perfect answer. The goal is to produce a defensible estimate that reflects your real situation so you can make a better decision.</p>

              <p>The calculator supports two practical starting points. If you know your take-home pay, select net pay and enter the amount and your pay frequency. If you only know your gross pay, select gross pay and provide an estimated tax rate so the calculator can approximate your take-home pay. Then enter your paid work hours per week and add optional inputs for unpaid overtime, commuting time, unpaid break time, and monthly work-related costs. The output highlights your real hourly wage and also shows a comparison against a simple hourly figure based only on paid hours.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Weeks per month are estimated as 4.333 to convert monthly amounts into weekly equivalents.</li>
                <li>Work-related costs are treated as ongoing monthly costs and are subtracted from estimated take-home pay.</li>
                <li>Commute time and unpaid breaks are counted as job-required time and are added to your effective weekly hours.</li>
                <li>If you select gross pay, the tax rate is a single blended estimate and will not match every tax system, deduction, or benefit structure.</li>
                <li>This tool is a comparison aid; for irregular schedules or commission-heavy roles, use averages over several months for best results.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is a “real hourly wage”?</h3>
              <p>It is your estimated take-home pay after work-related costs, divided by the total hours the job effectively consumes. That total includes paid hours plus unpaid time you still spend because of the job, such as commuting and unpaid overtime.</p>

              <h3>Should I use net pay or gross pay?</h3>
              <p>If you know your take-home pay, use net pay. It avoids tax guesswork. Use gross pay only when you do not have a reliable net figure, and keep the tax rate realistic. If your estimate is uncertain, try a low and high tax rate and see how much the real hourly wage changes.</p>

              <h3>Do I really count commuting and breaks as work time?</h3>
              <p>If the purpose is job comparison, yes. Commute and unpaid breaks consume your time because of the job, even if they are not compensated. If you are evaluating lifestyle impact or the true value of a pay increase, ignoring these hours can hide the real trade-off.</p>

              <h3>What should I include as work-related costs?</h3>
              <p>Include costs that you would not have if you did not have the job: commuting costs, parking, additional childcare, mandatory equipment, uniforms, lunches you buy because of the schedule, or mobile data required for work. Leave out normal household expenses that do not change with the job.</p>

              <h3>How do I handle irregular hours, overtime spikes, or hybrid work?</h3>
              <p>Use an average. For example, if you work late two weeks per month, average that overtime across the month. For hybrid work, reduce commuting days per week to match your typical schedule. The output becomes more useful when the inputs represent a normal month, not a best-case week.</p>

              <h2>Paycheck breakdown calculator for take-home pay</h2>

              <p>A paycheck breakdown calculator helps you estimate what you actually receive after taxes and deductions. Most people think about income as a salary figure or an hourly rate, but real life happens at the paycheck level. Your rent, groceries, fuel, and debt payments all come out of your net pay, not your gross pay. This calculator converts what you know into a usable estimate and shows a clean breakdown so you can see where the money goes.</p>

              <p>You can use this calculator in two ways. If you know your annual salary, choose the annual mode, select how often you get paid, and the calculator will estimate your gross pay per paycheck. If you already know your gross pay per paycheck, choose that mode and enter the number directly. Then, optionally add an estimated effective tax rate and any deductions. Pre tax deductions are amounts taken out before taxes are applied, like retirement contributions or certain benefits in some systems. Post tax deductions are taken out after tax, like some insurance premiums, union fees, or wage garnishments depending on your situation.</p>

              <p>The results are designed to be practical. You will see your estimated gross per paycheck, estimated taxes, estimated net pay, and a simple take home percentage. You also get monthly and annual net equivalents. This matters because people often compare expenses monthly but get paid weekly or biweekly. Converting to monthly and annual equivalents makes budgeting clearer and reduces guesswork. This is an estimate, not a payroll system. If you want higher accuracy, replace the default tax rate with a number closer to your real effective rate, and enter deductions that you know apply to each paycheck.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Tax is estimated using a single effective tax rate, not a detailed bracket or country specific payroll calculation.</li>
                <li>If you leave the tax rate blank, the calculator uses a default effective rate to produce a usable estimate.</li>
                <li>Pre tax deductions reduce the amount that is taxed in this simplified model.</li>
                <li>Post tax deductions are subtracted after taxes and do not change the tax estimate.</li>
                <li>Results are per paycheck and also converted to monthly and annual equivalents using standard pay period counts.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is the difference between gross pay and net pay?</h3>
              <p>Gross pay is your pay before taxes and deductions. Net pay, also called take home pay, is what lands in your bank account after taxes and all deductions are removed.</p>

              <h3>What tax rate should I use if I am not sure?</h3>
              <p>If you do not know your effective tax rate, start with the default and treat the result as a planning estimate. If you have a recent payslip, you can calculate your effective rate as total tax divided by gross pay for that pay period and enter that percentage for better accuracy.</p>

              <h3>How do I enter deductions if they are monthly but I am paid biweekly?</h3>
              <p>Convert the monthly deduction to a per paycheck amount. A quick approximation is monthly amount times 12, divided by paychecks per year. For biweekly, that is monthly amount multiplied by 12 and divided by 26.</p>

              <h3>Why does my real payslip differ from this calculator?</h3>
              <p>Real payroll includes country specific rules, tax brackets, thresholds, credits, employer contributions, and benefit calculations. This calculator uses a simplified effective rate and basic deduction handling. Use your real effective rate and accurate deductions to narrow the gap.</p>

              <h3>Can this calculator help with budgeting?</h3>
              <p>Yes. The most useful number for budgeting is your net monthly equivalent, because most bills are monthly. Use the monthly net result as your baseline income and plan spending and savings from there.</p>

            <h2>About this monthly budget calculator</h2>
            <p>
              This monthly budget calculator helps you compare your take home income to your core expenses and savings goals in one view. Enter your net income for the month and then fill in the main spending categories such as housing, utilities, groceries, transport, debt repayments, and other day to day costs. The calculator totals your expenses, shows how much of your income they use, and tells you how much is left over.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a space for a monthly savings goal. Once you enter a savings amount, the calculator checks whether your current budget can support it. If there is enough money left after expenses, you will see how much remains after saving. If there is not enough, the tool shows how short you are so you can decide where to cut back or whether to adjust your savings target.
            </p>

            <h3>Assumptions and how to use the tool</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The income field is meant to be your net monthly pay after tax and deductions, not your gross salary.</li>
              <li>You do not have to fill every expense line. Any blank or zero field is treated as no spending in that category.</li>
              <li>The calculator is built around typical household categories. You can treat them as buckets and group similar costs together if you want a quick view.</li>
              <li>If your total expenses are higher than your income, the result will highlight the overspend so you can see how far out your budget is.</li>
              <li>The savings goal is optional but useful if you are trying to build an emergency fund, pay off debt faster, or save for a specific target.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common questions</h3>

            <h3>What counts as monthly income?</h3>
            <p>
              Use the amount that actually reaches your bank account each month after tax, pension, and other automatic deductions. If your income is irregular, take a realistic monthly average over the last few months instead of a best case number.
            </p>

            <h3>Do I need exact amounts for every expense?</h3>
            <p>
              Exact numbers are ideal, but estimates are still useful. You can start with rough averages pulled from your bank statements, then refine the amounts later. The goal is to see the big picture of where your money is going.
            </p>

            <h3>What if my expenses are higher than my income?</h3>
            <p>
              The calculator will show that you are overspending and by how much. This is a signal to reduce costs, look for extra income, or both. Start with flexible categories such as other spending, entertainment, and eating out before cutting essential items.
            </p>

            <h3>Is this financial advice?</h3>
            <p>
              No. This is a simple arithmetic tool that works with the numbers you enter. It does not connect to your bank or make decisions for you. Treat the output as a clear snapshot that you can use alongside your own judgment or professional advice if needed.

              <h2>Rent affordability calculator for rent-to-income and housing cost checks</h2>

              <p>Rent feels simple until you add everything around it. The rent number is only one part of what you will actually pay each month, and it competes with transport, food, debt payments, and basic savings. This rent affordability calculator helps you quickly check whether a monthly rent amount fits your income, and it also lets you refine the answer with optional real-world costs.</p>

              <p>The calculator focuses on two common affordability ratios. The first is the rent-to-income ratio, which compares your monthly rent to your monthly take-home income. The second is a total housing cost ratio, which compares rent plus utilities to your income. These ratios are not laws. They are quick risk indicators that help you see whether you are likely to feel comfortable, stretched, or under pressure.</p>

              <p>For a practical view, this tool also estimates what you may have left after housing and debts. If you enter other monthly debt payments, the calculator will show your remaining income after rent, utilities, and debts. If someone else contributes to the rent, you can enter that too so the calculation reflects your share rather than the full rent.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Income is monthly take-home pay. If you only know gross income, treat results as approximate because tax and deductions can be large.</li>
                <li>Utilities are optional and may include electricity, water, gas, internet, and basic municipal charges. If you do not know the value, use a conservative estimate.</li>
                <li>Roommate or household contribution is treated as money that reduces your effective rent cost. If the contribution is unreliable, do not include it.</li>
                <li>Debt payments should include fixed monthly obligations like loan repayments, credit card minimums, and hire purchase payments, not variable spending like groceries.</li>
                <li>Affordability bands are guidance only. Your comfort level depends on lifestyle, dependents, medical costs, transport, and how stable your income is.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What rent percentage is considered affordable?</h3>
              <p>Many people use 30% of take-home income as a rough guideline for rent, but it is only a starting point. If you have low debt, predictable income, and low transport costs, you may be comfortable above 30%. If you have high debt, dependents, or irregular income, even 25% can feel tight. Use the ratios as a warning light, then look at the remaining-income number to judge day-to-day reality.</p>

              <h3>Should I use gross or net income?</h3>
              <p>Use net income if possible, meaning the money that arrives in your account after tax and deductions. Gross income can make rent look more affordable than it really is. If you must use gross income, treat the result as optimistic and consider testing a lower income figure to simulate deductions.</p>

              <h3>Do utilities count as part of rent affordability?</h3>
              <p>They should. A rent amount that looks fine on its own can become a problem once utilities and basic housing charges are added. This calculator shows both rent-to-income and housing-cost-to-income (rent plus utilities). If utilities vary a lot, use a higher estimate to avoid surprises.</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know my exact expenses or debts?</h3>
              <p>Leave optional fields blank and the calculator will still work. You will get a rent-to-income result and suggested rent limits based on your income. If you want a more realistic view, add one estimate at a time, starting with debt payments if you have any, then utilities. Your goal is not perfect precision, but to avoid a rent decision that depends on everything going right.</p>

              <h3>How can I improve accuracy before signing a lease?</h3>
              <p>Use your last two to three months of bank statements to estimate monthly averages for housing-related costs and fixed payments. Add buffer for seasonal changes such as higher winter electricity usage. If you expect income changes, test the calculator with a lower income to see if the rent would still be manageable. If the remaining income after housing and debts is thin, the risk is not the ratio, it is cash flow pressure.</p>

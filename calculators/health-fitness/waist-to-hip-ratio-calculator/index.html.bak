<h2>Waist-to-hip ratio calculator for checking fat distribution and health risk</h2>
<p>Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a simple measurement that compares your waist circumference to your hip circumference. People typically search for a WHR calculator because they want a quick way to understand whether their body fat is more concentrated around the waist (central fat) or more around the hips. Central fat distribution is often used as a practical screening signal for cardiometabolic risk, especially when combined with other information like blood pressure, blood lipids, glucose, and overall body weight.</p>
<p>This calculator is locked to one purpose: estimating your WHR from two tape-measure numbers and giving a plain-language interpretation. It is not a body fat percentage tool, it is not a BMI replacement, and it is not a medical diagnosis. It is a quick check you can repeat over time using consistent measurement technique so you can see trends, not just one-off readings.</p>
<p>To use it, pick your units (cm or inches), enter your waist circumference and hip circumference, and optionally choose sex so the calculator can apply commonly used cutoffs for interpretation. The main output is the WHR number (waist divided by hips). A higher WHR means your waist is large relative to your hips, which usually indicates more central fat distribution. The calculator also shows a secondary insight: your waist as a percentage of your hips, plus a simple “target waist” estimate (based on the selected interpretation threshold) so you can see what waist measurement would correspond to a lower-risk cutoff for your current hip size.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measurements should be taken with a flexible tape measure, snug but not compressing skin, while standing relaxed and breathing normally.</li>
<li>Waist measurement is assumed to be taken at a consistent point each time (commonly the narrowest point or around the navel). Consistency matters more than the exact spot.</li>
<li>Hip measurement is assumed to be taken at the widest part of the buttocks. Different placements can change WHR slightly.</li>
<li>Interpretation thresholds are general screening cutoffs, not personal medical rules. Athletes, older adults, and some body types may not fit neatly into categories.</li>
<li>WHR is only one indicator. For decisions about health risk, combine it with other indicators and professional advice when appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>What is a “good” waist-to-hip ratio?</h3>
<p>There is no single perfect number for everyone, but commonly used screening cutoffs treat lower ratios as generally better from a central-fat perspective. If you select sex, the calculator uses widely cited cutoffs where values above the cutoff suggest higher central fat distribution. Use the result as a directionally useful indicator, not a verdict.</p>
<h3>Does it matter whether I use cm or inches?</h3>
<p>No. WHR is a ratio. As long as both measurements use the same unit, the ratio is identical. The unit selection only affects how the calculator labels your measurements and any “target waist” value it prints.</p>
<h3>Where exactly should I measure my waist and hips?</h3>
<p>Different health organizations and studies use slightly different landmark definitions. For personal tracking, the most important rule is repeatability. Choose a method you can reproduce and stick with it. If you change measurement location, you may create a fake “trend” that is actually just technique drift.</p>
<h3>My hips are small, so my ratio looks high. Is that a problem?</h3>
<p>It can be. WHR increases if waist goes up or hips go down. The metric is about proportions, not just waist size. If you have naturally narrow hips, WHR can look higher even at a lower weight. That is why this tool is a screening indicator, not a diagnosis. If you want another quick metric to pair with WHR, waist circumference alone is also commonly tracked.</p>
<h3>How can I make the result more accurate?</h3>
<p>Use a consistent tape, measure at the same time of day (many people measure in the morning), keep posture and breathing consistent, and take two readings for each location then average them. If you are tracking progress, focus on the trend over weeks, not day-to-day fluctuations.</p>

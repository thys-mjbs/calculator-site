              <h2>Estimate how long it will take to reach your goal weight</h2>

              <p>
                This weight loss timeline calculator estimates how many weeks it could take to reach a target weight, and it shows an approximate goal date. The intent is simple: you have a current weight, you have a goal weight, and you want a practical time estimate based on an expected pace. That is the core decision most people are trying to make when they search for a “weight loss timeline” or “how long to lose X kg or lb”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The default result is designed to be useful even if you do not know your calorie deficit. Instead of forcing food logs or metabolic estimates, it uses a weekly weight loss rate as the driver. If you do not provide a weekly rate, the calculator uses a conservative default that is common in real-world planning. You still get a goal date, a total time estimate, and a few milestone dates to keep the plan measurable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The output includes a secondary insight: an estimated daily calorie deficit implied by the timeline. This is not a prescription, and it is not a substitute for medical advice. It is a simple translation from weight change over time into an energy number, so you can sanity-check whether the pace you entered is realistic for your situation. If the implied deficit is extreme, the timeline might be mathematically possible but practically hard to sustain.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>If you do not enter a weekly loss rate, the calculator uses a conservative default (0.5 kg per week or 1.0 lb per week) to avoid unrealistic timelines.</li>
                <li>The timeline assumes a steady average pace. Real weight change is not linear because water retention, glycogen, and adherence vary week to week.</li>
                <li>The “daily calorie deficit” estimate uses standard approximations (about 7,700 kcal per kg or 3,500 kcal per lb) as a planning conversion, not a guarantee.</li>
                <li>The calculator assumes your target weight is below your current weight. It is not designed for weight gain timelines.</li>
                <li>Milestone dates (25%, 50%, 75%) are simple checkpoints based on the same average pace, intended for planning and review, not exact predictions.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Is this calculator accurate if my weight fluctuates day to day?</h3>
              <p>
                Day-to-day fluctuations are normal and often driven by water, sodium, carbohydrates, stress, and training. This calculator is based on averages over weeks, not daily scale changes. If you weigh yourself daily, use a weekly average trend to compare against the timeline. If your weekly trend is slower or faster, update the weekly loss rate and recalculate.
              </p>

              <h3>What weekly loss rate should I use if I am not sure?</h3>
              <p>
                If you have no data, a conservative planning rate is usually better than an aggressive one because it reduces false expectations. Many people plan around 0.25 to 0.75 kg per week (or about 0.5 to 1.5 lb per week), but your situation can differ based on starting weight, activity, diet quality, and adherence. If you have prior results, use your actual average over the last 3 to 4 weeks.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the calculator show a daily calorie deficit?</h3>
              <p>
                People often think in calories, but they search for time. The deficit estimate bridges that gap: it tells you the approximate average energy gap implied by your pace. If the number is very high, the plan may be hard to sustain. If it is modest, the timeline may be more realistic. It is still an estimate and it does not account for individual metabolic differences or adaptation.
              </p>

              <h3>What if I do not know my start date or I want to start today?</h3>
              <p>
                Leave the start date blank and the calculator will assume today. If you are planning ahead, enter a start date in YYYY-MM-DD format. The goal date will shift based on that date. This is useful if you are working backward from an event or deadline and want to see if your plan has enough time.
              </p>

              <h3>When should I not rely on a timeline calculator like this?</h3>
              <p>
                If you have medical conditions, a history of disordered eating, are pregnant, are underweight, or are attempting a very large change quickly, you should not treat a timeline tool as a plan. Also, if your goal is performance, body composition (fat loss with muscle gain), or post-injury recovery, weight alone can be misleading. This calculator is specifically for estimating time to reach a lower scale weight at a steady average pace.
              </p>

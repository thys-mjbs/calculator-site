              <h2>Waist-to-height ratio calculator for central fat risk and waist target sizing</h2>

              <p>The waist-to-height ratio (often shortened to WHtR) is a quick way to estimate how much fat you carry around your midsection relative to your height. Unlike weight alone, it focuses on where fat is stored. For many people, excess abdominal fat is more strongly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular risk than overall body weight. This calculator is designed for a simple, common search intent: you have a waist measurement and a height measurement, and you want a straightforward ratio plus a practical target waist to aim for.</p>

              <p>To use the calculator, choose your units, then enter your waist circumference and height in the same unit. The calculator divides waist by height to produce your WHtR. It also shows a simple interpretation band and two practical reference points: a “keep waist under half your height” target (WHtR 0.50) and a higher-risk reference (WHtR 0.60). These extra outputs matter because most people are not trying to memorize ratios. They want a concrete waist number that matches their height and a clear sense of whether they are likely in a lower, moderate, or higher risk range.</p>

              <p>What the results mean in practice is simple. A lower WHtR generally indicates less central fat for your height, while a higher WHtR suggests more. If your ratio is close to a threshold, a small change in waist measurement can move you into a different band. That is normal and is one reason you should measure consistently. This calculator is not a medical diagnosis, and it is not a body composition analysis. It is a quick screen for central size relative to height, intended mainly for adults. If you are assessing athletic performance, pregnancy-related changes, or childhood growth, this tool is the wrong fit and you should use a context-specific approach.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Your waist and height are measured in the same unit (cm with cm, or inches with inches).</li>
                <li>Waist is measured at a consistent location each time (commonly around the midpoint between the lowest rib and the top of the hip bone, after a normal exhale).</li>
                <li>The interpretation bands are intended as a practical adult screening guide, not a diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Single measurements can be noisy; trends over time are more useful than one reading.</li>
                <li>This calculator does not adjust for pregnancy, childhood growth patterns, or specialized athletic body composition goals.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is a “good” waist-to-height ratio?</h3>
              <p>A commonly used practical rule is to keep waist circumference under half your height (WHtR below 0.50). This is not a guarantee of health, but it is an easy-to-remember screening threshold. If your result is below 0.50, you are generally in a lower central-size band for your height. If you are above 0.50, the main takeaway is that your waist is relatively large for your height, which is often used as a prompt to tighten diet, activity, sleep, and stress habits, or to speak to a clinician if other risk factors are present.</p>

              <h3>How do I measure my waist correctly?</h3>
              <p>Use a flexible tape measure and measure on bare skin or light clothing. Stand relaxed, breathe out normally, and do not pull the tape tight. Measure at the same spot each time. Many guides use the midpoint between the bottom of the rib cage and the top of the hip bone, but what matters most is consistency. If you measure at the narrowest point one day and at the navel the next, your WHtR will jump for reasons unrelated to real change.</p>

              <h3>Does it matter if I use centimeters or inches?</h3>
              <p>No, as long as you use the same unit for both measurements. WHtR is a ratio, so the units cancel out. If you enter waist in inches and height in centimeters, the ratio becomes meaningless. This is why the calculator asks you to pick a unit system first. If you only know one of the measurements in a different unit, convert it before using the calculator or measure again using the same tape and unit system.</p>

              <h3>My WHtR is close to a cutoff. What should I do?</h3>
              <p>If you are very close to a threshold, treat the result as a range rather than a precise label. Small changes in how tightly the tape is held, whether you measured after a meal, and normal day-to-day variation can move your reading. Re-measure a few times across a week under similar conditions and use the average. If your average sits above 0.50, the most useful output is the target waist value shown by the calculator. It translates the ratio into a concrete number you can track over time.</p>

              <h3>Is this better than BMI?</h3>
              <p>They answer different questions. BMI is weight relative to height and does not say where fat is stored. WHtR focuses on waist relative to height, which many people use as a quicker screen for central fat. If you only want one simple number tied to abdominal size, WHtR is often more actionable because you can measure waist directly and set a clear target. If you are using metrics for medical decision-making, it is better to look at multiple measures and your broader health context rather than relying on any single ratio.</p>

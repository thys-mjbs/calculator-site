              <h2>Daily water intake calculator for a practical hydration target</h2>

              <p>This daily water intake calculator estimates how much water you should aim to drink per day based on body weight, exercise time, climate, and a few optional factors. It is built for normal use, not clinical diagnosis. The goal is a number you can actually follow, plus a range so you are not treating hydration like a single exact target that you “miss” if you are slightly under.</p>

              <p>Most people want a quick answer, but hydration is affected by how heavy you are, how much you sweat, and how hot or dry your environment is. That is why this calculator starts with a baseline based on your weight and then adds sensible adjustments for exercise and heat exposure. If you skip optional inputs, you still get a valid result using standard defaults.</p>

              <p>Your result is shown as a daily total in liters and in US fluid ounces, plus a simple breakdown into 500 ml bottles, 250 ml cups, and an hourly pace if you spread it over a typical waking day. That breakdown is there because a total number is not helpful unless you can turn it into a plan.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Baseline hydration uses a common rule of thumb of about 35 ml of water per kilogram of body weight per day, before adjustments.</li>
                <li>Exercise adds extra water based on time and intensity. If you leave exercise blank, it assumes no added exercise water.</li>
                <li>Climate adds a small adjustment for warm or hot conditions to account for higher sweat loss and faster dehydration.</li>
                <li>Pregnancy and breastfeeding are treated as optional adjustments because fluid needs can increase. If you are unsure, select “None.”</li>
                <li>This calculator targets water and other non-alcoholic fluids. It does not estimate electrolyte needs and it does not replace medical advice for kidney, heart, or fluid balance conditions.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Is this the same as the “8 glasses a day” rule?</h3>
              <p>No. “8 glasses” is a rough public guideline that ignores body size, sweat, and environment. A smaller person may need less than that on some days, while a larger person training in heat can need significantly more. This calculator gives a weight-based baseline and then adds adjustments so the result is more personalized.</p>

              <h3>What counts toward my daily water total?</h3>
              <p>Plain water is the simplest. Unsweetened tea and similar low-calorie fluids can contribute too. Highly sugary drinks can be counterproductive for some people, and alcohol is dehydrating. If you are tracking seriously, treat water as the main source and consider other drinks as secondary contributors.</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know my exact exercise amount or intensity?</h3>
              <p>Leave exercise minutes blank for a quick baseline. If you want a better estimate, put your best guess in minutes and choose an intensity that matches your breathing and sweat level. The intensity selector exists so you can refine without needing technical data like sweat rate.</p>

              <h3>Can drinking too much water be a problem?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Very high intake in a short period can be unsafe for some people. This calculator includes a practical range so you are not chasing an extreme number. If you have medical conditions that affect fluid balance, or you are advised to restrict fluids, follow your clinician’s guidance instead of a general calculator.</p>

              <h3>How can I make the estimate more accurate for me?</h3>
              <p>Use your real weight, add your typical daily exercise minutes, and pick the right climate setting. Then sanity-check the result with real-world signals such as thirst, urine color (pale straw is commonly considered a good sign), and how you feel during exercise. If you consistently feel dehydrated despite meeting the target, increase slightly within the range and consider electrolytes for heavy sweating.</p>

              <h2>Calculate the average (mean) of multiple numbers in seconds</h2>

              <p>An average is the single most common way people summarize a set of values into one representative number. If you have a list of test scores, weekly expenses, workout metrics, survey responses, or any repeating measurement, the arithmetic mean gives you a quick sense of the “typical” value. This Average Calculator is built for the most common real-world intent: you already have a list of numbers and you want the mean, fast, without setting up a spreadsheet.</p>

              <p>To use it, paste your values into the Numbers box. You can separate values with commas, spaces, semicolons, or new lines. Then click “Calculate average.” The calculator reads each value, ignores empty entries, and computes the arithmetic mean using the standard formula: sum of all included numbers divided by the count of included numbers. Along with the average, it also shows the count of values used, the total sum, and the minimum and maximum. Those supporting figures help you sanity-check the input so you do not trust a mean that was produced from the wrong data.</p>

              <p>The Advanced option “Ignore zeros” exists for one specific situation: sometimes a zero in your list does not mean a true zero, it means “missing.” For example, a gradebook might export blank assignments as 0, or a tracking sheet might use 0 as a placeholder when no measurement was taken. If that is your situation, enabling “Ignore zeros” will exclude any exact 0 values from both the sum and the count so your mean reflects only the observed entries. If zero is a real value in your context (like temperature, profit, or distance), leave that option off.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This calculator computes the arithmetic mean (standard “average”), not median or weighted averages.</li>
                <li>Values can be separated by commas, spaces, semicolons, or line breaks; empty items are ignored.</li>
                <li>“Ignore zeros” removes only exact 0 values; negative numbers are allowed and treated normally.</li>
                <li>If your list contains outliers (one very large or very small value), the mean will shift toward that outlier.</li>
                <li>Results are displayed to two decimal places; internal calculation uses full precision before rounding.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is the difference between average and mean?</h3>
              <p>In everyday usage, “average” usually means the arithmetic mean: add all values and divide by how many values you have. Statistically, “average” can also refer to other measures like median or mode, but this calculator is intentionally locked to the arithmetic mean because that is what most users want when searching for an average calculator.</p>

              <h3>Can I paste numbers with line breaks or mixed separators?</h3>
              <p>Yes. You can paste values separated by commas, spaces, semicolons, or new lines in any combination. The calculator scans the text, extracts number-like entries, and ignores blanks. If your paste includes text labels, remove them first so you do not accidentally include something that is not meant to be part of the calculation.</p>

              <h3>Why does the calculator show count, sum, min, and max?</h3>
              <p>Those are quick checks. The count confirms how many values were actually included. The sum helps you spot missing rows or duplicated entries. The min and max highlight obvious outliers that might be typos (like entering 500 instead of 50). If any of those look wrong, fix your list and recalculate.</p>

              <h3>When should I use “Ignore zeros”?</h3>
              <p>Use it only when 0 is acting as a placeholder for missing data in your list. If zero is a real measurement that should influence the average, do not ignore it. Example: if you are averaging monthly sales and one month truly had zero sales, excluding it would inflate the mean and mislead you.</p>

              <h3>What if I want a weighted average or median?</h3>
              <p>This page is not designed for that. A weighted average needs weights for each value, and a median requires sorting and different interpretation. If your decision depends on weights (like grade components or survey importance), you should use a dedicated weighted average tool. If you need robustness against outliers, median is often better than mean.</p>

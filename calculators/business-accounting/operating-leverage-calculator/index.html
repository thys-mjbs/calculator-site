              <h2>Operating leverage (DOL) calculator for fixed costs, variable costs, and profit sensitivity</h2>

              <p>Operating leverage explains why two businesses with the same revenue can have very different risk. If your business has high fixed costs (rent, salaries, software, equipment leases), small changes in sales can create bigger changes in operating profit. That is the core idea behind degree of operating leverage (DOL). This calculator turns a few numbers you can usually estimate from your income statement into a simple sensitivity view you can use for planning.</p>

              <p>To use this calculator, start with a single period (a month, quarter, or year) and enter revenue, total variable costs, and total fixed operating costs. Variable costs are costs that move with sales volume (for example cost of goods sold, packaging, transaction fees, delivery costs). Fixed operating costs are costs that do not change much in the short term (for example salaries, rent, insurance, subscriptions, and baseline utilities). From those inputs, the calculator finds your contribution margin, your operating profit (EBIT), and your degree of operating leverage when it is meaningful.</p>

              <p>The main output, DOL, is a sensitivity multiplier around your current level of sales. If your DOL is 3, a 10% change in sales is estimated to drive about a 30% change in operating profit, assuming your cost structure stays the same. This is useful for scenario planning, pricing decisions, and deciding how aggressive you can be on growth spend. It is also useful as a warning sign: high DOL can mean big upside when sales rise, but it also means profit can collapse quickly when sales fall.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This is a short-term, cost-structure snapshot. Fixed costs are treated as fixed for the period you enter, and variable costs are treated as proportional to sales.</li>
                <li>Variable costs should include only costs that truly scale with sales volume. If you mix in fixed costs, your results will be distorted.</li>
                <li>DOL is most useful when operating profit (EBIT) is positive and not near zero. If EBIT is zero or negative, sensitivity ratios can become misleading.</li>
                <li>The sales change scenario is an approximation around the current point. Large changes in sales can break the assumption that fixed and variable costs behave the same way.</li>
                <li>Taxes, interest, one-off items, and capital expenditure are excluded. This is about operating performance, not net profit or cash flow timing.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is operating leverage in plain language?</h3>
              <p>Operating leverage is the idea that fixed costs create amplification. When fixed costs are high, extra revenue tends to fall to profit faster after you cover those fixed costs. But the same fixed costs also hurt more when revenue drops, because they do not shrink quickly. DOL is a way to measure that amplification at your current revenue level.</p>

              <h3>What is the difference between contribution margin and operating profit?</h3>
              <p>Contribution margin is revenue minus variable costs. It shows what is available to cover fixed costs and then become profit. Operating profit (EBIT) is contribution margin minus fixed operating costs. If your contribution margin does not cover fixed costs, EBIT is negative, which means you are operating at a loss for that period.</p>

              <h3>Why does the calculator sometimes say DOL is not meaningful?</h3>
              <p>DOL uses operating profit in the denominator. When EBIT is zero or close to zero, the ratio can explode to very large values or flip signs with small changes in inputs. In those cases, it is more practical to focus on break-even sales and safety margin (how far above break-even you are) rather than a sensitivity multiplier.</p>

              <h3>How can I improve the accuracy if I do not know my variable costs exactly?</h3>
              <p>Use your best estimate and sanity-check it as a percentage of revenue. If you have a gross margin figure, you can back into variable costs: variable costs roughly equal revenue times (1 minus gross margin). If your business has both fixed and variable components inside cost of sales, keep the split consistent and update it later as you get better data.</p>

              <h3>When should I not use operating leverage for decisions?</h3>
              <p>Avoid relying on DOL when you are changing your business model, pricing, staffing, or product mix, because your cost behavior may shift. Also avoid using it for very large forecast jumps where step-changes in fixed costs are likely (for example hiring a new team, adding a second location, or buying capacity). In those cases, use a more detailed budget model with multiple cost bands.</p>

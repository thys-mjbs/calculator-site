              <h2>Use this birthday calculator to find your next birthday date and how many days are left</h2>

              <p>This birthday calculator is built for one main job: planning your next birthday from a real calendar date. People search for this when they want to book leave, plan a weekend, set reminders, arrange travel, or coordinate a dinner with friends. The calculator takes your date of birth and works out the next time your birthday occurs, based on today or an optional “as of” date you choose. It then shows how many days remain, the weekday your birthday falls on, and the age you will turn on that date. The result is practical because it answers the planning questions that matter: what date should you put on your calendar, and how soon is it.</p>

              <p>How to use it is simple. Enter your date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format, for example 1995-07-18. If you want to plan from a different day, such as “as of next Monday” or “as of the first of next month,” enter that date too. If you leave the “as of” date blank, the calculator uses today. When you click calculate, you will get a clean summary. The next birthday date is the exact calendar day to plan around. The days remaining figure is the number of whole days from the chosen “as of” date to your next birthday. If the result says 0 days, it means the “as of” date is your birthday. The weekday is included because it changes the decision: a Friday birthday tends to be handled differently from a Tuesday birthday, and this affects leave, travel, and event timing.</p>

              <p>The calculator also shows age context. “Age you will turn” is the age on the upcoming birthday, which is usually what people care about for plans, invitations, and milestone decisions. It also shows your current age as of the chosen “as of” date so the output makes sense even when your birthday is close. This page is not trying to answer adjacent questions like a full life expectancy estimate, numerology, zodiac, or a minute-by-minute age tracker. It is strictly a planning tool for the next birthday date, time remaining, weekday, and age turning. If you need a precise time-to-the-second countdown, you should use a separate countdown timer utility. This calculator stays focused because most users want a quick, decision-ready answer with minimal inputs.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Dates must be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format to avoid ambiguous day and month ordering.</li>
                <li>“Days remaining” is calculated using whole calendar days (midnight to midnight), not hours and minutes.</li>
                <li>If you were born on February 29, the calculator treats February 28 as your birthday in non-leap years for planning purposes.</li>
                <li>If the optional “as of” date is blank, the calculator uses your current local date (your device time).</li>
                <li>If your date of birth is after the “as of” date, the calculator will not guess and will ask for a valid earlier birth date.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Does this calculate my exact age in years, months, and days?</h3>
              <p>No. This calculator is focused on planning the next birthday. It shows your current age in years and the age you will turn on your next birthday, plus the date and weekday. If you need a detailed age breakdown, use an age calculator designed specifically for that purpose.</p>

              <h3>Why does “days remaining” sometimes look off by one day?</h3>
              <p>Because this tool uses whole calendar days, not hours. If it is late at night, you might feel like your birthday is “tomorrow,” but the calendar-day math treats it as one day remaining until midnight passes. This is intentional because planning is usually done by date, not by hour.</p>

              <h3>What if my birthday is today?</h3>
              <p>If the “as of” date is the same as your birthday date in the current year, the calculator will show 0 days remaining and clearly state that your birthday is today, along with the age you are turning.</p>

              <h3>What happens if I was born on February 29?</h3>
              <p>In non-leap years, this calculator uses February 28 as the planning date. Some people celebrate on March 1 instead. If you personally use March 1, treat the output as a close planning estimate and adjust your reminder by one day in non-leap years.</p>

              <h3>Can I plan ahead from a future date, like next month?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Enter a future “as of” date to answer planning questions like “how many days until my birthday after I return from a trip” or “how close is my birthday as of the first day of next quarter.” The tool will calculate the next birthday relative to that date.</p>

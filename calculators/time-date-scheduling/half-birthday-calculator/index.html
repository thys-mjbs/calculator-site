              <h2>Half-birthday calculator for finding the date and days until your half birthday</h2>

              <p>A half-birthday is the date that falls roughly halfway between two birthdays. In everyday use, most people mean a simple, consistent rule: your half-birthday is six calendar months after your birthday. This Half-Birthday Calculator is built for that exact intent. You enter a date of birth, and the calculator returns the next half-birthday date, the most recent half-birthday, and how many days remain until the next one.</p>

              <p>This is most useful for planning a small mid-year celebration, scheduling age-related milestones (like a school cutoff discussion or a kid-friendly “halfway to your birthday” event), or setting reminders when you want something to happen about six months after someone’s birthday. The calculator also shows your next full birthday and a quick “timeline” so you can see where your half-birthday sits in relation to today.</p>

              <p>To use it, enter your date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format. Optionally, enter an “as of” date if you want the results based on a different day than today (for example, planning ahead from a future date, or calculating from a date in the past). If you leave the “as of” date blank, the calculator uses today’s date on your device. The output gives the next half-birthday date, the days remaining, and the recent half-birthday date so you can confirm the cycle.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This calculator defines a half-birthday as exactly six calendar months after the birthday in each year, not “half the days of the year.”</li>
                <li>If the target month does not have the same day number (for example, moving from the 31st to a month with fewer days), the date is clamped to the last valid day of that month.</li>
                <li>If you were born on February 29, the calculator treats your birthday in non-leap years as February 28 for the purpose of computing the half-birthday.</li>
                <li>“Days until” is calculated using whole days based on local time, so it can differ by 1 day if you run it near midnight or change time zones.</li>
                <li>This tool is for planning and personal use, not for legal or contractual definitions of age or eligibility.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Is a half-birthday exactly half of a year?</h3>
              <p>In common usage, it means six calendar months after your birthday. That is usually close to half a year, but it is not always exactly 182 or 183 days because months have different lengths. This calculator uses the six-month rule because it is the most practical and widely understood definition for planning.</p>

              <h3>What happens if my birthday is on the 29th, 30th, or 31st?</h3>
              <p>If adding six months lands in a month that does not have that day number, the calculator uses the last day of the target month. For example, if your birthday is August 31, your half-birthday will be the last day of February (February 28 or 29 depending on the year). This avoids invalid dates and matches how most calendar-based “month adding” works in real life.</p>

              <h3>How does this handle February 29 birthdays?</h3>
              <p>For people born on February 29, the calculator treats the birthday in non-leap years as February 28 when building the “birthday in this year” anchor. It then adds six months from that anchor. This keeps results stable and avoids creating dates that do not exist in most years.</p>

              <h3>Why does the “days until” number look off by one?</h3>
              <p>“Days until” is counted in whole days based on local time. If you run the calculator late at night, or if your device’s time zone changes, the difference in partial days can round in a way that looks off by one. For planning, rely on the displayed date first, and treat the day count as an approximate countdown.</p>

              <h3>Can I use this to calculate someone’s exact age at their half-birthday?</h3>
              <p>This calculator focuses on dates and countdown timing. It will show the next half-birthday date and your next birthday so you can infer the age milestone (for example, halfway between turning 10 and 11). If you need exact legal age calculations at a specific timestamp, you should use an age calculator that accounts for time of day and jurisdiction rules.</p>

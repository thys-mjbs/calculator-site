              <h2>Break time allocation calculator for work shifts and daily schedules</h2>

              <p>
                This Break Time Allocation Calculator helps you turn a single number, your total break time, into a
                practical break plan for a work shift. Most people know how long they are working and roughly how many
                minutes of break they can take, but they struggle to decide how to split that break time. The result is
                usually one of two problems: breaks that are too short to be restorative, or breaks that are taken too
                late, too early, or in a way that breaks focus.
              </p>

              <p>
                This calculator is intentionally focused on one job: planning breaks inside a fixed shift. It is not a
                payroll or compliance tool and it does not attempt to model every labor law, union agreement, or company
                policy. Instead, it gives you a clean, defensible plan: one long break (when you have enough time) plus a
                number of short breaks, with a simple timing suggestion so you can apply it immediately.
              </p>

              <p>
                How to use it: enter your shift length in hours and your total break time in minutes. If you do nothing
                else, the calculator will use reasonable defaults to build a plan. If you want more control, open the
                advanced fields and set a minimum long break (for example, 30 minutes) and the number of short breaks
                you prefer (for example, 2). The calculator will then allocate minutes across the long break and short
                breaks and provide a suggested schedule based on common work patterns: a short break in the first half, a
                long break around the middle, and another short break in the second half. The timing is expressed as
                “minutes from shift start” so it works whether you start at 07:00 or 13:00.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Shift length is treated as a fixed block of time. If your shift end time is flexible, use your planned
                  working time as the shift length.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Total break time is assumed to be the total you are allowed or willing to take. The calculator does not
                  add extra breaks beyond what you enter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A long break is only created when the total break time is large enough to support it. If it is not, the
                  calculator allocates everything into short breaks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The suggested timing is a planning guide, not a rule. Move breaks earlier or later based on meetings,
                  commuting between sites, or workload spikes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Short break durations are split evenly from the remaining time after the long break, then rounded to a
                  practical whole minute.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What if I only have a small amount of break time?</h3>
              <p>
                If your total break time is too small to support a meaningful long break, the calculator will skip the long
                break and split your time into short breaks. This avoids a “token” long break that is not actually useful.
              </p>

              <h3>Do I have to fill in the advanced fields?</h3>
              <p>
                No. The advanced fields are optional. If you leave them blank, the calculator uses sensible defaults so you
                still get a complete plan. Use advanced settings only if you want your break plan to match a specific
                preference or policy.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does it suggest a long break near the middle of the shift?</h3>
              <p>
                For most people, a mid-shift long break is the least disruptive and the easiest to remember. It also tends
                to match real workplace patterns such as lunch. If your work has fixed meal times, keep the durations and
                move the timing to match reality.
              </p>

              <h3>What if my break policy requires specific break lengths?</h3>
              <p>
                Use the advanced minimum long break to match your policy and then set the number of short breaks to fit the
                remaining time. If your policy is strict (for example, two 15-minute breaks plus a 30-minute lunch), you can
                check whether your total break minutes supports that plan and adjust accordingly.
              </p>

              <h3>How can I make the plan more realistic for a meeting-heavy day?</h3>
              <p>
                Treat the schedule as a baseline and then move break windows around your calendar. The value is in the
                allocation and the reminder that breaks should be spaced. If you expect a long meeting block, schedule a
                short break immediately before and after it.
              </p>

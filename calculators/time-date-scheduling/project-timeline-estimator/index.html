              <h2>Project timeline estimator to predict an end date from effort and capacity</h2>

              <p>A project timeline estimate is only useful if it turns a rough effort guess into a calendar finish date you can actually plan around. Most people can estimate effort in hours (or at least pick a believable range), but they under-estimate everything that happens between “work exists” and “work is finished”: context switching, meetings, waiting for feedback, rework, and days that are not truly productive. This calculator is designed for one dominant decision: when to promise a realistic delivery date for a small, single-stream project where work is mostly sequential and the goal is a practical schedule.</p>

              <p>Start with the two inputs you usually know: a start date and an estimated total effort in hours. From there, the calculator converts effort into required workdays by dividing by capacity. Capacity is the number of people contributing multiplied by the productive hours each person can deliver per workday. Productive hours are not the same as hours “at work”. A typical default of 6 productive hours per day is a blunt but defensible assumption for knowledge work, because it leaves room for coordination and interruptions without pretending a full 8 hour block is realistic.</p>

              <p>Next, the calculator translates workdays into a calendar end date by applying working days per week. If you work 5 days a week, weekends are skipped. If you work 6 days a week, only Sundays are skipped. If you work 7 days a week, every day counts. Finally, the buffer adds a simple contingency percentage to the total effort so the output is not an optimistic best-case. The result block shows the estimated finish date, how many workdays the effort requires, how many calendar days the schedule spans, and the implied daily throughput. This keeps the output actionable: you can see what drives the schedule and which lever actually moves the end date.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This estimator is for small projects with one main workstream, not complex plans with dependencies, parallel critical paths, or formal project management scheduling.</li>
                <li>Total effort is treated as the main driver. If your effort estimate is wrong, the end date will be wrong, even if the maths is perfect.</li>
                <li“Productive hours per workday” means real focused output time. Meetings, admin, and waiting for approvals are not counted as productive output.</li>
                <li>The working week is assumed to start on Monday, and the first workdays are Monday onward (for example 5 days means Monday to Friday).</li>
                <li>The buffer is applied to total effort as a simple percentage to cover normal delays and rework, not major scope changes.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Why does adding one more person not always halve the timeline?</h3>
              <p>Because this calculator assumes additional people add linear capacity, but in real projects the work is not always parallel and coordination overhead increases. If the work can be split cleanly, adding people helps. If the work requires constant review, handoffs, or shared context, the “productive hours per person” should be lowered to reflect that reality. The fastest way to keep the estimate honest is to reduce productive hours per person rather than pretending communication is free.</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know productive hours per day?</h3>
              <p>Use the default. For most office or knowledge work, 6 productive hours per day is a reasonable starting point. If your environment is meeting-heavy, use 4 or 5. If the work is hands-on and interruptions are minimal, 7 may be realistic. The point is not to be perfect, it is to avoid an 8 hour assumption that usually produces a finish date you cannot meet.</p>

              <h3>Does the start date count as day one even if it is a weekend?</h3>
              <p>No. If your start date falls on a non-working day based on your “working days per week” setting, the calculator starts on the next available workday. This prevents confusing results where a schedule “uses up” a weekend day even though no work happens.</p>

              <h3>Should I use a buffer, and how big should it be?</h3>
              <p>If you are promising a date to someone else, use a buffer. A common practical range is 10% to 25% depending on uncertainty and how often you expect rework or waiting time. If you already built waiting time into the effort estimate, keep buffer smaller. If the work is novel or requirements are unclear, buffer should be higher. This calculator keeps buffer simple on purpose so it stays usable.</p>

              <h3>When is this estimator the wrong tool?</h3>
              <p>If your project has multiple parallel teams, hard external dependencies, formal milestones, or a critical path that changes based on sequencing, this approach is too simple. It is also the wrong tool when the primary problem is scope definition rather than scheduling. In those cases, you need project planning, not a quick timeline estimate from hours.</p>

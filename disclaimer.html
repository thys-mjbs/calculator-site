          <p>
            This Disclaimer applies to SnapCalc and all calculators, utilities,
            tools, pages, content, and outputs provided on this website. The site
            exists to help users estimate values, explore scenarios, and improve
            clarity when working with numbers. It is not a substitute for
            professional judgement, official sources, or regulated advice.
          </p>

          <h2>No financial, legal, tax, investment, medical, engineering, or professional advice</h2>
          <p>
            All calculators and content on SnapCalc are provided for general
            informational and educational purposes. The website operator is not
            acting as a financial advisor, accountant, tax practitioner, attorney,
            investment consultant, medical practitioner, engineer, or licensed
            professional through the operation of this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing on SnapCalc should be interpreted as professional advice,
            recommendations, approvals, certifications, instructions, or guarantees
            for your specific situation. If you require professional advice, consult
            an appropriately qualified professional who can assess your situation
            directly and reference official sources and requirements.
          </p>

          <h2>General information only</h2>
          <p>
            Calculator outputs and explanatory text are designed for general reference
            and estimation. SnapCalc may use simplified assumptions, default values,
            rounding, and generic conversion factors to keep tools usable. Those
            assumptions may not reflect your jurisdiction, industry, contract terms,
            employer policies, insurance terms, local regulations, building codes,
            safety requirements, medical guidance, or other context that can materially
            change outcomes.
          </p>

          <h2>No guarantee of accuracy or suitability</h2>
          <p>
            SnapCalc makes no warranties regarding accuracy, completeness, suitability,
            availability, timeliness, or reliability of any calculator, output, or
            content. Results can be incorrect or misleading if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inputs are inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent</li>
            <li>Units are mixed or misunderstood</li>
            <li>Assumptions built into a tool do not match real-world conditions</li>
            <li>Rounding or approximations meaningfully affect the result</li>
            <li>External rules, rates, policies, or standards have changed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You must independently verify results before relying on them, especially
            where errors could cause financial loss, contract disputes, compliance
            issues, health impacts, safety risks, or engineering failures.
          </p>

          <h2>User responsibility for inputs and interpretation</h2>
          <p>
            You are responsible for choosing appropriate inputs, confirming values are
            correct, and interpreting outputs responsibly. SnapCalc cannot validate your
            intent or your constraints. Examples or helper text are general guidance only
            and do not reduce your obligation to verify outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a result appears incorrect, treat it as unverified, cross-check with an
            independent source, and report the issue via the Contact page with the page
            URL and the input values used.
          </p>

          <h2>Use at your own risk</h2>
          <p>
            You use this website and its calculators at your own risk. To the maximum
            extent permitted by law, SnapCalc and the website operator are not liable
            for loss, damage, cost, injury, liability, or negative outcomes arising
            from use of or reliance on the site, its calculators, its outputs, or any
            information displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This includes direct and indirect outcomes such as lost profits, financial
            losses, missed deadlines, incorrect budgeting decisions, contractual issues,
            medical or fitness outcomes, construction errors, engineering miscalculations,
            and other consequences arising from reliance on calculator results.
          </p>

          <h2>No client, advisory, or professional relationship</h2>
          <p>
            Using SnapCalc does not create a client relationship, advisory relationship,
            fiduciary relationship, or professional duty of care between you and the
            website operator. No professional services are provided through availability
            of calculators or content.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-party links, ads, and external resources</h2>

            resources. The site may also display advertising and include affiliate
            links. These are provided for convenience. SnapCalc does not control and
            is not responsible for third-party content, accuracy, availability, security,
            or privacy practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you follow a third-party link or interact with a third-party service, you
            do so at your own discretion and under that third party’s terms and policies.
            SnapCalc is not responsible for transactions, purchases, disputes, losses, or
            outcomes resulting from third-party interactions.
          </p>

            errors, or modify site content at any time. Tools may be added, removed, or

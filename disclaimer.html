                This Disclaimer applies to SnapCalc and all calculators, utilities,
                tools, pages, content, and outputs provided on this website. The site
                exists to help users estimate values, explore scenarios, and improve
                clarity when working with numbers. It is not a substitute for
                professional judgement, official sources, or regulated advice.
              </p>

              <h2>No Financial, Legal, Tax, Investment, Medical, Engineering, or Professional Advice</h2>
              <p>
                All calculators and content on SnapCalc are provided strictly for
                general informational and educational purposes. The website operator
                is not acting as a financial advisor, accountant, tax practitioner,
                attorney, investment consultant, medical practitioner, engineer, or
                licensed professional in any capacity through the operation of this
                site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nothing on SnapCalc should be interpreted as professional advice,
                recommendations, approvals, certifications, instructions, or guarantees
                of correctness for your specific situation. If you require professional
                advice, you must consult an appropriately qualified professional who
                can evaluate your situation directly, apply the correct rules and
                standards, and reference official sources and requirements.
              </p>

              <h2>General Information Only</h2>
              <p>
                Calculator outputs and explanatory text are designed to be useful for
                general reference and estimation. SnapCalc may include simplified
                assumptions, default values, rounding, and generic conversion factors
                to make tools easy to use. Those assumptions may not reflect your
                jurisdiction, industry, contract terms, employer policies, insurance
                terms, local regulations, building codes, safety requirements, medical
                guidance, or other context that materially changes outcomes.
              </p>

              <h2>No Guarantee of Accuracy or Suitability</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc makes no representations or warranties regarding accuracy,
                completeness, suitability, availability, timeliness, or reliability of
                any calculator, output, or content. Calculators rely on formulas,
                assumptions, and user inputs, and results can be incorrect or
                misleading if:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Inputs are inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent</li>
                <li>Units are mixed or misunderstood</li>
                <li>Assumptions built into a tool do not match real-world conditions</li>
                <li>Rounding or approximations meaningfully affect the result</li>
                <li>External rules, rates, policies, or standards have changed</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You must independently verify all results before relying on them,
                especially where errors could cause financial loss, contract disputes,
                compliance issues, health impacts, safety risks, or engineering failures.
              </p>

              <h2>User Responsibility for Inputs and Interpretation</h2>
              <p>
                You are responsible for choosing appropriate inputs, confirming that
                values are correct, and interpreting outputs responsibly. SnapCalc does
                not know your goals, constraints, or legal obligations, and cannot
                validate your intent. If a tool provides examples or helper text, that
                material is for general guidance only and does not reduce your
                obligation to validate outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you notice a result that appears incorrect, you should treat it as
                unverified, cross-check with independent sources, and report the issue
                via the Contact page with the page URL and the input values used.
              </p>

              <h2>Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
              <p>
                You use this website and all calculators entirely at your own risk.
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, SnapCalc and the website
                operator are not liable for any loss, damage, cost, injury, liability,
                or negative outcome arising from the use of or reliance on the site,
                its calculators, its outputs, or any information displayed.
              </p>
              <p>
                This limitation applies to direct and indirect outcomes, including (but
                not limited to) lost profits, financial losses, missed deadlines,
                incorrect budgeting decisions, contractual issues, medical or fitness
                outcomes, construction errors, engineering miscalculations, and other
                consequences arising from reliance on calculator results.
              </p>

              <h2>No Client, Advisory, or Professional Relationship</h2>
              <p>
                Accessing or using SnapCalc does not create a client relationship,
                advisory relationship, fiduciary relationship, or professional duty of
                care between you and the website operator. No obligations are created
                by your use of the website, and no professional services are being
                delivered through the availability of calculators or content.
              </p>

              <h2>Third-Party Links, Ads, and External Resources</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may contain links to third-party websites, tools, services, or
                resources. The site may also display advertising via third-party ad
                networks and may include affiliate links. These items are provided for
                convenience and informational purposes. SnapCalc does not control and
                is not responsible for third-party content, accuracy, availability,
                security, or privacy practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you follow a third-party link or interact with a third-party service,
                you do so at your own discretion and subject to that third party’s terms
                and policies. SnapCalc is not responsible for any transactions, purchases,
                disputes, losses, or outcomes that result from third-party interactions.
              </p>

              <h2>Updates, Changes, and Maintenance</h2>
              <p>
                SnapCalc may update calculators, adjust formulas, improve explanations,
                correct errors, or modify site content at any time. Tools may be added,
                removed, or changed without notice. Outputs and explanatory text may
                therefore change over time as the site is refined.
              </p>

              <h2>Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
              <p>
                This Disclaimer may be updated periodically to reflect changes in site
                functionality, policies, legal requirements, or operational practices.
                Updates are effective once posted on this page. Your continued use of
                the website after changes are posted indicates acceptance of the updated
                Disclaimer.
              </p>

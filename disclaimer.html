              <p>
                All calculators on this website are provided strictly for
                general informational and educational purposes. The website
                owner is not a financial advisor, accountant, tax practitioner,

              <p>
                Nothing on this website should be interpreted as formal advice,

              <h2>No Guarantee of Accuracy</h2>
              <p>
                Calculators rely on formulas, assumptions, user inputs, and
                simplified models that may not match real-world systems. Errors
                may exist in:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Formulas or calculations</li>
                <li>Interpretation of results</li>
                <li>Rounding, approximations, or default values</li>
                <li>User-entered data and assumptions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You must independently verify all results before relying on
                them.
              </p>

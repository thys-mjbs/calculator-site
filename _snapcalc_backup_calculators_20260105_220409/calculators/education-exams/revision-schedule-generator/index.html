<h2>Revision schedule generator for one upcoming exam</h2>
<p>This revision schedule generator builds a day-by-day plan for a single exam date. The goal is simple: turn a fixed deadline into a realistic set of daily actions that you can follow without constantly re-planning. You enter your exam date, your daily study time in minutes, and either a topic list (comma-separated) or a topic count. The output is a schedule that mixes topic coverage, spaced review, practice test days, and catch-up buffer days, with optional rest days.</p>
<p>This tool is designed for the most common search intent: a student who knows when the exam is and needs a practical revision timetable for the remaining days. It is not a course planner and it is not meant for juggling multiple subjects across multiple exam dates. If you have multiple exams, generate a schedule per exam and then manually resolve conflicts. That keeps each plan clean and keeps the “one exam, one plan” logic consistent.</p>
<p>How it works in plain terms: the generator counts the days from your start date to the day before the exam, then removes rest days if you add them. Those remaining study days are split into phases. The early phase focuses on covering all topics at least once. The middle phase reinforces recall and understanding through mixed review. The final phase (closest to the exam) is reserved for final review and consolidation. Practice tests are placed in the later part of the schedule, because tests are most useful after you have seen the content at least once. Buffer days are sprinkled in to absorb real life interruptions and harder-than-expected topics.</p>
<p>To use it well, start with honest daily minutes. If you pick an unrealistic number, the schedule will look “complete” but you will not execute it. Next, decide whether to provide topic names. If your syllabus is already broken into chapters or sections, add the names. If not, a topic count still works and you can translate “Topic 7” into your own notes. Finally, set your optional values (rest days, practice tests, final review days, buffer percent) to match your habits. If you rarely take full rest days, set rest days per week to zero. If your exam is practical or problem-based, increase the practice tests number and reduce the topic coverage pressure by giving yourself more buffer.</p>
<p>The schedule output gives you two layers of usefulness. First, it gives a clear daily task for each date, which removes decision fatigue. Second, it gives a quick summary: total study days, total study hours, and what proportion of days are coverage, review, practice, buffer, and final review. That helps you see if your plan is balanced. If you look at your output and it is heavily skewed to coverage with no time to review or test yourself, you should change the advanced settings before you commit.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>This plan is for one exam with one exam date, and it schedules work from your start date up to the day before the exam.</li>
<li>Daily study time is treated as a consistent target; the plan does not adapt to day-to-day variation unless you use buffer days to catch up.</li>
<li>Rest days are evenly spaced using a simple weekly pattern rather than matching your exact personal calendar.</li>
<li>Practice tests are assumed to take roughly one full study session each (your daily minutes), including marking and error review.</li>
<li>Topic workload is treated as roughly even unless you manually use buffer days to give extra time to harder topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>Does the schedule include the exam day?</h3>
<p>No. The schedule runs up to the day before the exam. Most people use the exam day for light review only, logistics, and sleep. If you want a light exam-day plan, reduce final review days by one and treat the day before the exam as your “exam day light pass.”</p>
<h3>What if I do not know my exact start date?</h3>
<p>Leave the start date blank and the plan starts today based on your device date. If you plan to start tomorrow or next week, enter the start date explicitly so the schedule does not silently assume extra days you will not use.</p>
<h3>What if my topics are not equal difficulty?</h3>
<p>This generator assumes topics are roughly similar. In real life, they are not. Use buffer days as “difficulty insurance.” When you hit a hard topic, use the next buffer day to extend it. If you know you have many hard topics, increase buffer percent and reduce practice tests slightly.</p>
<h3>How many practice tests should I schedule?</h3>
<p>For many academic exams, two practice tests is a realistic minimum if you have enough time. If your exam is heavily problem-solving, increase practice tests and keep at least one final review day for consolidating mistakes. If you have very few days left, keep practice tests low and focus on targeted review instead.</p>
<h3>What if I miss a day and fall behind?</h3>
<p>Do not rewrite the whole plan. Use the nearest buffer day to catch up. If you have no buffer days left, combine two small tasks into one day and reduce a review day, not a coverage day. Coverage ensures you see everything at least once; review can be compressed when time is tight.</p>

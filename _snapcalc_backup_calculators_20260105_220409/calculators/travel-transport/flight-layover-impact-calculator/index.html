<h2>Flight layover impact calculator to check if your connection is safe</h2>
<p>
                A scheduled layover time is not the same thing as usable time. When people search for a “safe layover” or “is a 45 minute layover enough”, what they usually mean is: after you land, can you realistically reach the next gate before boarding closes. This calculator answers that specific decision by subtracting common airport time costs from your scheduled layover and showing your remaining buffer.
              </p>
<p>
                The primary result is your <strong>effective buffer</strong> in minutes. That buffer is what you have left after deplaning, walking between gates or terminals, possible security re-screening, possible immigration, and an extra cushion (because a connection with zero cushion is a connection you are betting your trip on). If the effective buffer is negative, your schedule is mathematically impossible under the assumptions you entered.
              </p>
<p>
                Use the default settings if you just want a quick sanity check. If you know something specific about your trip, such as a long terminal transfer, a bus gate, or a likely security re-screening, open the Advanced section and adjust the time costs. The calculator is not trying to predict airline policies or airport rules. It is focused on the personal planning question: “Do I have enough real time to make this connection without sprinting and hoping?”
              </p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduled layover is gate-to-gate time only.</strong> The calculator assumes your layover starts when your first flight lands and ends at the departure time of the next flight, then subtracts real movement and process time from it.</li>
<li><strong>Time costs are estimates, not airport guarantees.</strong> Walking, security, and immigration can vary widely by airport, time of day, staffing, and whether terminals are connected.</li>
<li><strong>Connection type changes risk tolerance.</strong> “Same ticket” assumes you can accept a smaller buffer because the itinerary is usually managed as one journey. “Self-transfer” assumes you should carry more buffer because you may need to re-check, re-clear, or re-enter landside depending on the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Boarding cutoff is treated as part of your buffer.</strong> The extra buffer input is your personal cushion for gate closure, boarding time, and small delays. Increase it if you want lower stress.</li>
<li><strong>This calculator does not cover special cases.</strong> It does not account for visa requirements, airport-specific minimum connection times, checked-bag policies, or whether an airline will rebook you. It is purely a time-impact and buffer calculator.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>What is the difference between layover time and effective buffer?</h3>
<p>
                Layover time is the published gap between flights. Effective buffer is what remains after subtracting the time you actually spend getting off the first plane, moving through the airport, and dealing with checkpoints. Effective buffer is the number that matches real stress and real risk.
              </p>
<h3>Why does “separate tickets (self-transfer)” usually require more buffer?</h3>
<p>
                Self-transfer connections carry extra failure modes. You might need to enter landside to collect bags, re-check bags, clear security again, or deal with separate check-in rules. Even when those steps do not apply, the downside of missing the second flight is typically higher, so a larger buffer is rational.
              </p>
<h3>What if I do not know the walking, security, or immigration times?</h3>
<p>
                Leave the defaults and treat the output as a sanity check, not a promise. If the result already looks tight with defaults, it will not magically become safe with more detail. If the result looks comfortable, you can refine it by increasing any time costs you suspect might be higher for your airport or itinerary.
              </p>
<h3>How should I set the “extra buffer” value?</h3>
<p>
                Set it based on how much uncertainty you want to absorb. A small buffer means you are comfortable with a brisk walk and no meaningful delays. A larger buffer means you want time for gate changes, queues, bathroom breaks, or minor inbound delays. If you are traveling with kids, older travelers, or carry-on complexity, increase the buffer.
              </p>
<h3>Does a “safe” result mean I will definitely make the connection?</h3>
<p>
                No. A safe result means that under the assumptions you entered, you have meaningful slack after typical airport time costs. Large inbound delays, long queues, terminal disruptions, or operational changes can still break a connection. The correct use is decision support: compare itineraries and choose one with a healthier effective buffer.

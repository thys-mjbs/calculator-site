<h2>Battery capacity calculator for runtime (Ah and Wh)</h2>
<p>
                This Battery Capacity Calculator estimates the battery size you
                need to power a device for a specific number of hours. The
                dominant use case is planning a battery setup for a known
                electrical load (usually expressed in watts), at a known battery
                or system voltage (such as 12V, 24V, or 48V), where you want a
                quick, defensible answer in amp-hours (Ah) and watt-hours (Wh).
                This is the decision most people are trying to make: “How big a
                battery do I need to run this thing for that long?”
              </p>
<p>
                You enter three basics: device load in watts, the battery or
                system voltage, and your desired runtime in hours. The
                calculator then converts that into energy required (watt-hours),
                and finally into battery capacity (amp-hours). If you open the
                Advanced section, you can include efficiency losses (common when
                using an inverter or DC to DC conversion) and the usable depth
                of discharge (how much of the battery you actually plan to use).
                Those two optional settings are the difference between an
                optimistic paper result and a practical setup that actually
                delivers the runtime you expect.
              </p>
<p>
                The results are shown as a minimum required battery capacity and
                a practical recommendation. The minimum tells you the
                theoretical amount of capacity needed under the assumptions you
                selected. The recommendation is a simple “round up” guidance
                because batteries are sold in standard sizes and because real
                usage is rarely perfectly steady. If you provide a typical
                single-battery size in the Advanced section (for example a 12V
                100Ah battery), the calculator also estimates how many batteries
                of that type you would need to meet the recommended capacity.
                This is meant for quick planning, not for detailed electrical
                design.
              </p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>
                  The load (watts) is treated as an average steady draw over the
                  full runtime. If your device cycles on and off, use an average
                  wattage.
                </li>
<li>
                  If you leave efficiency blank, the calculator assumes 90%
                  efficiency to reflect typical losses in wiring and conversion
                  equipment.
                </li>
<li>
                  If you leave depth of discharge blank, the calculator assumes
                  80% usable capacity. This is a common practical planning
                  value.
                </li>
<li>
                  The calculator outputs energy in Wh and capacity in Ah using
                  the relationship Wh = V × Ah. Voltage is assumed constant for
                  planning purposes.
                </li>
<li>
                  The optional “number of batteries” estimate assumes identical
                  batteries and is a sizing guide only. Series/parallel wiring,
                  surge currents, temperature, and manufacturer limits are not
                  modeled.
                </li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>What is the difference between Ah and Wh?</h3>
<p>
                Amp-hours (Ah) is capacity at a specific voltage. Watt-hours
                (Wh) is energy and is easier to compare across voltages. A 12V
                100Ah battery is roughly 1,200Wh (12 × 100), but the usable
                energy depends on how much you are willing to discharge it and
                on system losses.
              </p>
<h3>Why do efficiency and depth of discharge matter?</h3>
<p>
                Efficiency accounts for losses, especially when converting
                battery power to another form (like DC to AC via an inverter).
                Depth of discharge (DoD) reflects that you typically do not use
                100% of a battery’s rated capacity in real life. Including both
                makes the result more realistic and reduces the chance of
                under-sizing.
              </p>
<h3>My device draw is in amps, not watts. Can I still use this?</h3>
<p>
                This page is locked to the “watts + voltage + hours” sizing
                decision. If you only have amps, you can convert to watts using
                watts = volts × amps, then enter the watts here. If you are
                unsure which voltage applies (device vs inverter vs battery
                bus), use the system voltage that your battery setup actually
                runs at.
              </p>
<h3>Why is my result larger than what I expected from the battery label?</h3>
<p>
                Battery labels are usually nominal capacity at ideal conditions.
                Real-world runtime is reduced by conversion losses, usable
                discharge limits, and the fact that voltage and available
                capacity can drop under higher loads. If you want a conservative
                plan, keep DoD at 80% or lower and do not assume 100%
                efficiency.
              </p>
<h3>When does this calculator not apply?</h3>
<p>
                This tool is not for precise engineering of battery banks, surge
                loads, or motor starting currents. It also does not model
                temperature effects, battery chemistry curves, or
                manufacturer-specific limits. If you are designing a critical
                system (medical, safety, or high-current industrial), use
                detailed manufacturer data and a full electrical design
                approach.

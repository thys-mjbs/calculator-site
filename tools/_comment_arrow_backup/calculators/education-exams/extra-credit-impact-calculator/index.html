<h2>Extra credit impact calculator for points-based grades</h2>
<p>Extra credit can be confusing because different classes apply it in different ways. Some teachers add extra points directly to your earned score, while others increase the total points possible, or apply extra credit only inside a weighted category. This page is locked to one common situation: a points-based course where extra credit points are added to your earned points without increasing the points possible. If your syllabus matches that model, this calculator gives you a quick and practical estimate of the grade change.</p>
<p>Use it when you already have a running total of points earned and points possible, and you want to know what happens if you earn a certain amount of extra credit. You can also enter a target grade percentage to see how many extra credit points you would need to reach that target from your current standing. This is useful for deciding whether an optional assignment is worth the time, or whether you should focus on regular assignments instead.</p>
<p>The results are shown as your current grade percentage and your estimated new grade percentage after adding the extra credit. You will also see the percentage-point increase (the difference between the two percentages). If you enter a target grade, the calculator estimates the extra credit points required and indicates whether your planned extra credit is enough to reach the target. It does not guess your future assignment scores, and it does not try to predict a final course grade. It is a “right now” impact check for extra credit on your current points so far.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>This calculator assumes a points-based grading system where extra credit increases points earned but does not increase points possible.</li>
<li>It uses your current totals so far, not your final course totals, so the impact can change as more graded work is added later.</li>
<li>It allows results above 100% because some classes permit grades over 100% when extra credit is added.</li>
<li>It assumes the points you enter are already summed correctly across assignments, quizzes, tests, and any included components.</li>
<li>If your course uses weighted categories, drops the lowest scores, curves grades, or treats extra credit differently, the estimate may not match your official gradebook.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>Why can extra credit raise my grade by less than I expected?</h3>
<p>The impact depends on the size of your denominator (points possible). Ten extra points means more when you have 100 points possible than when you have 1,000 points possible. The calculator shows the percentage-point increase so you can see the real impact at your current scale.</p>
<h3>What if my teacher adds extra credit to points possible too?</h3>
<p>Then this model is wrong for your class. In that setup, extra credit may have a smaller effect because the denominator increases as well. This calculator intentionally does not cover that use case, because it requires a different formula and can produce misleading results if mixed.</p>
<h3>Can I use this to predict my final grade at the end of the term?</h3>
<p>No. This tool uses your totals so far. Future assignments increase points possible, and your future scores can outweigh the extra credit impact. Use this as a short-term decision tool, not a full grade forecast.</p>
<h3>If my grade is already above 100%, is that an error?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily. Some instructors allow grades above 100% when extra credit points are added to earned points. If your course caps grades at 100%, treat anything above 100% as “at least 100%,” and confirm the policy in your syllabus.</p>
<h3>How do I make the estimate more accurate?</h3>
<p>Use the exact totals from your gradebook, and make sure “points possible so far” matches what your instructor is currently counting. If some assignments are not yet graded or are excluded until later, exclude them from your totals. If the course is weighted or curved, this calculator will not match your official system.</p>

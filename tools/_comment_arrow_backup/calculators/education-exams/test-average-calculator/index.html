<h2>Test average calculator for current grade and needed next score</h2>
<p>A “test average” is the simplest way most classes track performance: add your test scores, divide by the number of tests, and you get your current average. This calculator does that quickly from a list of scores, then adds one practical feature students actually search for: if you set a target average, it estimates the score you would need on your next test to reach that target.</p>
<p>The dominant intent this page targets is straightforward: you already have multiple test marks and you want to know where you stand right now, plus whether a realistic next test score can pull your average up to a specific goal (for example 80%, 85%, or a pass threshold). It is not a full “final grade” calculator with assignments, attendance, projects, or weighted categories. If your class uses separate categories (tests, homework, labs), this tool is not designed for that scenario.</p>
<p>To use it, paste your completed test scores into the score list field. You can type them with commas or spaces, like “78, 84, 91, 73”. Set the score scale if your tests are not out of 100. Then, optionally, enter a target average and (if relevant) a next test weight. Weight is a simple way to model a “double test” without forcing you to re-enter every past test weight. If you already know your next test score, you can enter it to see your projected average after that test as well.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>All completed scores are assumed to be on the same scale (for example, all out of 100). If they are not, convert them first or change the scale to match.</li>
<li>Completed tests are treated as equally weighted, unless you use the “Next test weight” option for the upcoming test only.</li>
<li>The target average is interpreted as “average after adding the next test,” not “average right now.” If you want to check your current average only, leave the target field empty.</li>
<li>Scores are assumed to be valid within 0 to the score scale you enter. If your class allows extra credit above the scale, this calculator will treat that as out of range.</li>
<li>The “needed next score” is a mathematical requirement based on your inputs. It does not guarantee a grading curve, moderation, or other adjustments your teacher might apply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>Why does the calculator say my target is impossible?</h3>
<p>If the needed next score is greater than your score scale (for example, you need 112 out of 100), then the target average cannot be reached with just the next test under the assumptions used. That does not mean you cannot reach the goal later. It means one test is not enough to pull the average up by that amount.</p>
<h3>What does “next test weight” actually do?</h3>
<p>It treats the next test as if it counts like multiple normal tests. A weight of 2 means the next score is counted twice when calculating the average after the next test. This is a simplified model for a “double test” or a higher-stakes exam, without changing how your past tests are handled.</p>
<h3>Should I enter percentages or raw marks?</h3>
<p>Either is fine as long as you stay consistent with the score scale. If your test is 45 out of 60, you can either enter 75 with a scale of 100 (percentage), or enter 45 with a scale of 60 (raw marks). Do not mix raw marks and percentages in the same list.</p>
<h3>What if I only have one or two test scores so far?</h3>
<p>The average still works. Just understand that early averages swing a lot. With only one test, your “average” is just that score. With two tests, one strong or weak mark can move the average significantly. The “needed next score” estimate will often look extreme early in the term because the sample size is small.</p>
<h3>Does this include homework, assignments, or exam categories?</h3>
<p>No. This page is intentionally locked to the “test-only average” use case. If your grade is a weighted mix of tests and other components, you need a category-weighted grade calculator instead. Using this tool for a weighted course will give you a number that looks plausible but is not the grading method your class uses.</p>

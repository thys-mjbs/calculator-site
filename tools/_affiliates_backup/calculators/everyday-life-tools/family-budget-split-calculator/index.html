              <h2>Family budget split calculator for shared household expenses</h2>

              <p>
                When multiple adults share a home, the hardest part is not the math. It is deciding
                what “fair” looks like when rent, groceries, utilities, and other shared costs have
                to be paid every month. This family budget split calculator is designed for one
                specific decision: how much each person should contribute toward shared monthly
                household expenses, either equally or in proportion to income.
              </p>
              <p>
                The two most common approaches are an equal split and an income-based split. Equal
                split is simple and fast: divide the total shared expenses by the number of people.
                Income-based split aims to reduce strain on the lower earner by assigning each
                person a share that matches their share of total household income. This calculator
                shows both styles with practical outputs so you can agree on a split and move on.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use it, start with your best estimate of total shared monthly expenses. This
                should include the items everyone benefits from, such as rent or bond repayment,
                groceries, electricity, water, internet, and shared subscriptions. Then choose a
                split method. If you choose income-based split, enter at least two monthly incomes
                and optionally add up to two more. If you choose equal split, enter the number of
                people sharing the expense total. The result shows the monthly amount per person,
                each person’s percentage share, and simple weekly and daily equivalents to make the
                numbers feel real.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  “Shared expenses” means costs that benefit the household as a whole (rent,
                  utilities, shared groceries), not personal spending like individual debt payments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In income-based mode, the split is proportional to the incomes you enter (if one
                  person earns 60% of total income, they pay 60% of shared expenses).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In equal mode, everyone pays the same amount regardless of income, because that
                  is the point of this method.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weekly equivalents use 52 weeks per year divided by 12 months (about 4.33 weeks
                  per month). Daily equivalents use 365 days per year divided by 12 months (about
                  30.42 days per month).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The calculator assumes all entered incomes are monthly take-home or monthly gross,
                  but you must be consistent. Mixing gross and take-home will distort “fairness.”
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What expenses should I include in “shared monthly expenses”?</h3>
              <p>
                Include only costs that the household shares: housing, utilities, shared groceries,
                internet, security, and shared subscriptions. If you want to include personal items
                (like a car payment that only one person benefits from), handle those separately
                and keep the split discussion clean.
              </p>

              <h3>Is splitting by income always “fairer” than splitting equally?</h3>
              <p>
                Not always. Income-based splitting reduces pressure on the lower earner and often
                feels fair when incomes differ. Equal splitting is simple and can feel fair when
                incomes are similar or when both people contribute in other non-financial ways. The
                method you choose is a values decision. The calculator just gives you the numbers
                clearly.
              </p>

              <h3>What if one person has irregular income or is temporarily unemployed?</h3>
              <p>
                Use an average monthly income estimate if earnings fluctuate, or choose equal mode
                if that fits your household agreement. If someone is temporarily earning nothing,
                income-based mode will push nearly all shared expenses onto the earners, which may
                be accurate in the short term. If that is not acceptable, renegotiate what is
                “shared” or agree on a minimum contribution outside this calculator.
              </p>

              <h3>Should I use gross income or take-home income for the income-based split?</h3>
              <p>
                Use whichever is more meaningful for your decision, but do not mix them. Take-home
                (after tax) often aligns better with affordability. Gross income can be useful if
                your household wants a simple rule and both people have similar tax situations. If
                taxes, benefits, or deductions differ a lot, take-home usually produces a more
                realistic split.
              </p>

              <h3>How can I improve accuracy if our expenses vary month to month?</h3>
              <p>
                Use a three-month average for shared expenses and a three- to six-month average for
                income (especially if commissions or overtime are involved). You can also rerun the
                calculator when a major cost changes, such as rent increases, a new utility rate, or
                a change in employment. The goal is consistency, not perfection.
              </p>

              <h2>Annual fuel cost calculator for quick budgeting and trip planning</h2>

              <p>Fuel is one of those costs that feels small in the moment and large over a year. This annual fuel cost calculator helps you estimate how much you spend on fuel based on three inputs you can usually find or guess: how far you drive in a year, how efficient your vehicle is, and what you pay for fuel. The result is useful for budgeting, deciding whether a longer commute is worth it, and comparing vehicles that have different real-world efficiency.</p>

              <p>The calculator is built for both quick estimates and more accurate planning. If you just want a rough number, use your best guess for annual distance and a typical efficiency figure for your car. If you want better accuracy, use your actual annual distance from service records or odometer photos, and use your real efficiency from recent fill-ups rather than the manufacturer’s headline figure. Small changes in efficiency and fuel price compound over the year, so even a “close enough” estimate can give you a realistic annual range.</p>

              <p>Your main output is the estimated annual fuel cost. To make the number more actionable, the calculator also shows how much fuel you use over the year, an estimated monthly fuel cost, and a cost per distance unit (per km or per mile). These extra outputs make it easier to compare scenarios. For example, if your annual distance increases by 20 percent, the annual fuel cost usually increases by about 20 percent as well. If fuel price changes, the cost changes linearly. If your vehicle’s efficiency changes, the relationship is still predictable, but the impact can be larger than people expect over a full year.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Your driving pattern is treated as consistent across the year, even though real usage often varies by season and holiday travel.</li>
                <li>Fuel price is assumed to be a single average price for the year, not a month-by-month series.</li>
                <li>Fuel efficiency is assumed to be your real-world average, not best-case or worst-case performance.</li>
                <li>The estimate focuses on fuel spend only and does not include maintenance, tyres, insurance, tolls, or depreciation.</li>
                <li>If you enter approximate values, the output should be treated as a planning estimate rather than an exact accounting figure.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What should I use for “annual distance” if I do not know it?</h3>
              <p>If you do not track mileage, start with a simple estimate: typical weekly distance multiplied by 52. If your driving is irregular, add a buffer for occasional long trips. A more accurate option is to check your last service invoice or inspection report, compare the recorded odometer to today’s odometer, and scale that distance up to a full year.</p>

              <h3>Which fuel efficiency number is best: the manufacturer’s figure or my own?</h3>
              <p>Your own real-world average is better for budgeting. Manufacturer numbers are often achieved in controlled test conditions. If you have no real-world data, use a conservative estimate: assume efficiency is a bit worse than the headline rating, especially if you drive in heavy traffic, use air conditioning often, or do many short trips.</p>

              <h3>Does this account for stop-start traffic and city driving?</h3>
              <p>Only indirectly. City driving affects fuel efficiency. If your commute is mostly city traffic, enter an efficiency value that reflects that. If you only have a highway efficiency figure, reduce it to reflect real conditions. The calculator then correctly scales the cost based on that average.</p>

              <h3>How do I improve accuracy without making this complicated?</h3>
              <p>Use an average fuel price (what you actually pay most often) and a realistic efficiency value from a recent period. A practical method is to take the litres or gallons you bought over a month, divide by the distance you drove, and convert it into km/L or mpg. Even one month of real data typically improves the estimate more than guessing the “right” annual distance.</p>

              <h3>Why does a small change in fuel efficiency change the cost so much?</h3>
              <p>Because you buy fuel based on distance driven. If efficiency drops, you need more fuel for the same distance, and the extra fuel is purchased at today’s price. Over thousands of kilometres or miles per year, small efficiency differences can add up. This is also why comparing vehicles using cost per km or per mile can be more meaningful than comparing a single tank cost.</p>

              <h2>Travel days calculator for counting days away between two dates</h2>

              <p>
                A “travel days” number sounds simple, but people often mean different things. Some need the number of calendar
                days a trip covers for a leave request or a hotel booking window. Others need the number of nights away to
                estimate accommodation cost. This travel days calculator is built for one decision: counting trip duration
                between two dates in a way that matches common real-world policies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Start by choosing a start date and an end date. Then pick a counting method. Inclusive counting treats both the
                departure day and the return day as travel days, which is common for leave forms and per-diem schedules. Exclusive
                counting excludes the end date, which matches many “days between dates” interpretations. Nights counting reports
                the number of nights away, which is usually what accommodation pricing depends on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result section shows the primary answer first, then a small set of supporting figures. You will see an
                equivalent “weeks plus days” view that helps for longer trips, and a nights figure (even when you are counting
                inclusive or exclusive) so you can sanity-check hotel nights. If you keep the breakdown enabled, the calculator
                also separates weekdays and weekend days within the same span, which helps when you are estimating business
                travel days versus personal time.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Dates are treated as full calendar days in your local time, not as hours or flight time. If you need “hours
                  traveled,” this is the wrong tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inclusive counting means the start and end date are both included. If start and end are the same date, the
                  inclusive result is 1 day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Exclusive counting means the end date is excluded. If start and end are the same date, the exclusive result
                  is 0 days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nights are calculated as the number of midnights between the start and end date. If the end date is the next
                  day, that is 1 night.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Weekday and weekend breakdown uses a simple rule: weekdays are Monday to Friday and weekend days are Saturday
                  and Sunday, based on the dates in the selected span.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What counting method should I use for a leave request or per-diem claim?</h3>
              <p>
                If the form treats both the departure day and the return day as “days away,” use Inclusive. If the policy says
                “from start date up to but not including the return date,” use Exclusive. If the policy pays per night of
                accommodation, use Nights.
              </p>

              <h3>Why do “days” and “nights” usually differ?</h3>
              <p>
                A trip can cover two calendar days but only one night. For example, leaving on Monday and returning on Tuesday
                is 2 days (inclusive) but 1 night. Nights track overnights. Days track calendar dates.
              </p>

              <h3>What happens if my end date is before my start date?</h3>
              <p>
                The calculator will stop and ask you to fix the dates. A trip duration cannot be negative, and swapping the
                dates is the most common mistake.
              </p>

              <h3>Does this handle time zones and crossing the international date line?</h3>
              <p>
                No. This tool counts calendar dates, not actual elapsed hours. If your itinerary crosses time zones and you need
                “true elapsed time,” you need a time zone based duration tool, not a date-span counter.
              </p>

              <h3>How can I make the result match a company policy exactly?</h3>
              <p>
                Use the same definition your policy uses. If the policy is vague, default to Inclusive for “travel days” and
                Nights for accommodation. If weekends are treated differently in your policy, use the weekday/weekend breakdown
                as a quick audit of what portion of the trip falls on weekends.
              </p>

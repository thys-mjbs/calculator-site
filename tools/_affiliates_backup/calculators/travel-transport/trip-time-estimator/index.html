              <h2>Time zone converter for travel times (UTC offset based)</h2>

              <p>This travel time zone converter is built for a single practical job: take a local date and time from one place and convert it into the local date and time in another place, using UTC offsets. This is the situation travelers face constantly. You see a flight departure time, hotel check-in window, tour start time, train departure, or local meeting time printed in one location’s local time, but you need to understand what that moment means in the time zone you care about right now. The primary decision is simple: “What date and time will this be there?”</p>

              <p>The tool intentionally uses UTC offsets instead of city names. That is not a downgrade. For travel, you often already have the offset from a boarding pass, itinerary, airport listing, or a quick lookup. Offsets also avoid hidden surprises from ambiguous time zone names, and they allow half-hour and quarter-hour zones. You enter the “From” offset (where the time is expressed), the “To” offset (where you want the converted time), then the local date and local time in the “From” location. The calculator returns the converted local date and time in the “To” location, plus the time difference so you can sanity-check the result.</p>

              <p>The output is designed to be usable immediately. The main converted time is shown first and clearly. Under that, you see the time difference between the two locations and whether the conversion crosses midnight (previous day or next day). That last detail matters for travel because it’s how people miss hotel check-ins, call someone at 03:00, or misread an arrival as “same day” when it is not. If you want to double-check yourself, you can also swap the offsets and convert in the opposite direction.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>You must enter the correct UTC offsets for the specific travel date. Many places change offsets during daylight saving time, and this tool does not auto-detect DST.</li>
                <li>Offsets are entered in hours and can include decimals, such as +5.5 or +9.75. The calculator treats these as fixed offsets for the conversion.</li>
                <li>The date and time you enter are assumed to be local to the “From” location, not your device’s time zone.</li>
                <li>Input time is expected in 24-hour format (HH:MM). If you are using a 12-hour clock, convert it before entering.</li>
                <li>This calculator converts one moment in time between two offsets. It is not for scheduling across multiple participants, and it does not choose time zones based on city names.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Why does this tool ask for UTC offsets instead of cities?</h3>
              <p>Because travel planning usually needs a fast, unambiguous conversion. City-based time zones require a database and DST rules, which can be right or wrong depending on date, location, and political changes. If you already know the offsets for your travel date, offset conversion is direct and predictable. If you do not know the offsets, look them up once for the specific date, then convert reliably.</p>

              <h3>How do I enter half-hour or quarter-hour time zones?</h3>
              <p>Use decimals. For example, UTC+5:30 becomes +5.5, and UTC+9:45 becomes +9.75. The calculator converts offsets into minutes internally, so these values work as expected. If you enter +5:30 with a colon, it will not parse correctly. Use +5.5 instead.</p>

              <h3>What does “crosses midnight” mean in the result?</h3>
              <p>It means the converted local time in the destination falls on a different calendar day than the time you entered. For example, a late-night departure might convert to “next day” in the destination. That is normal. This matters when your booking, check-in, or event is tied to a date rather than just a clock time.</p>

              <h3>What if the offsets change because of daylight saving time?</h3>
              <p>Then the conversion depends on the date. Many regions shift by one hour during parts of the year. This calculator assumes the offsets you entered are correct for the date you entered. If you are unsure, verify both offsets for the specific date (not “current time”) and then run the conversion.</p>

              <h3>Can I use this to plan a call with someone in another country?</h3>
              <p>You can, but only if you already know both UTC offsets for the call date and time. This page is locked to travel conversion between two offsets, not general meeting scheduling across multiple people or automatic city-based time zones. If you need city selection and DST automation, use a city-based planner tool instead.</p>

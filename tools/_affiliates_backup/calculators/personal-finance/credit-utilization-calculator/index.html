              <h2>Credit utilization calculator for credit cards and revolving credit</h2>

              <p>Credit utilization is a simple ratio: how much of your available revolving credit you are using right now. It is usually expressed as a percentage. If your total credit limit is 50,000 and your total outstanding balance is 12,500, your utilization is 25%. Many people look up a “credit utilization calculator” because they want to understand whether their current balances are likely to be viewed as high risk by lenders and credit scoring systems.</p>

              <p>This calculator is locked to one job: help you assess your current utilization and estimate the payment needed to reach a target utilization level. It is not an interest calculator and it does not estimate a credit score. It is designed for a normal decision: “Should I pay down my card balance (and by how much) to get utilization under a target percentage?”</p>

              <p>To use it, enter your total credit limit across your credit cards and any other revolving credit lines you want to include. Then enter your current total balance outstanding. The primary output is your current utilization percentage. If you open the Advanced section, you can set a target utilization percentage (default is 30% if you leave it blank) and optionally enter a planned payment amount. The calculator will show the maximum balance you can carry to stay at the target, how much you would need to pay today to reach that target, and what your utilization would be after your planned payment.</p>

              <p>Understanding the outputs is straightforward. Your utilization percentage tells you how “full” your available revolving credit is. A lower number usually indicates more unused capacity and less reliance on credit. The “payment needed to reach target” is simply the amount your current balance must drop to be at or below the target utilization, assuming your credit limit does not change. The “utilization after planned payment” helps you test a quick scenario, like paying 2,000 now and the rest later.</p>

              <p>Because people often have multiple cards, this calculator uses totals. That is intentional. It gives you a fast, practical picture of the overall ratio. If you want to manage at a per-card level, you should run the numbers for each card separately, but the core decision is the same: reduce balances or increase available limit to change the ratio.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Your “total credit limit” is the combined limit of the revolving accounts you include. If you exclude a card, exclude both its limit and its balance.</li>
                <li>Your “current balance” is the total outstanding balance at the point you care about (for example, right now, or your statement balance). Pick one and stay consistent.</li>
                <li>The target utilization default is 30% if you leave the target blank. You can set any target from 1% to 100%.</li>
                <li>Planned payment is treated as an immediate reduction in balance. The calculator does not model new spending, pending transactions, or timing within a billing cycle.</li>
                <li>If your balance exceeds your limit (over-limit), the calculator still works and will show utilization above 100%, but the payoff-to-target number assumes your limit stays unchanged.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is credit utilization, exactly?</h3>
              <p>It is the percentage of your revolving credit limit that is currently used. The formula is balance ÷ limit × 100. It applies to credit cards and similar revolving credit, not installment loans like a car loan where the “limit” concept is different.</p>

              <h3>Should I use my current balance or my statement balance?</h3>
              <p>Use the balance that matches your decision. If you are deciding whether to pay down before a statement closes, use your current balance. If you are reviewing last month’s position, use the statement balance. The calculator works either way as long as your credit limit matches the accounts included.</p>

              <h3>Why does this calculator default the target to 30%?</h3>
              <p>Many people aim for a utilization level that is “not high” for general credit hygiene. A 30% target is a common rule-of-thumb people search for. It is not a guarantee and it is not a score estimate. If you have a stricter target, enter it in Advanced.</p>

              <h3>What if my utilization is already low but my score is still not improving?</h3>
              <p>Utilization is only one factor. This calculator does not attempt to diagnose a credit score. If your utilization is low, other issues may matter more, such as missed payments, short credit history, too many recent applications, or errors on your report. This tool only answers the utilization question.</p>

              <h3>How can I make this calculation more accurate for my situation?</h3>
              <p>Use totals that match a real snapshot. Confirm limits from your account pages, include only revolving accounts you want to measure, and use a balance figure that aligns with your timing. If you are planning a payment, enter the amount you will actually pay and avoid mixing it with future planned spending.</p>

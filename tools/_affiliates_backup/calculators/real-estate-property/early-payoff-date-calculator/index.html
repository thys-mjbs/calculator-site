              <h2>Early payoff date calculator for loans and mortgages</h2>

              <p>Paying off a loan early is one of the simplest ways to reduce total interest, but the impact is often hard to “feel” just by looking at a monthly payment. This early payoff date calculator turns your current balance, interest rate, and monthly payment into a clear timeline: an estimated payoff month and year, the number of payments remaining, and the total interest you are likely to pay from today onward. It also lets you test an extra monthly payment so you can see the trade-off between paying a little more now and finishing sooner. This is useful for home loans, personal loans, vehicle finance, and any installment loan where interest is charged on the outstanding balance.</p>

              <p>To use it quickly, enter your current loan balance, your annual interest rate (APR), and the monthly payment you plan to make. If you want to model an acceleration strategy, add an extra monthly amount, even something small. The calculator will show two scenarios: your baseline payoff (no extra) and your accelerated payoff (with extra). The most useful outputs are the payoff date and the “months saved,” because those translate directly into time and cash flow. The total interest is also important: even when the payment increase looks modest, the interest saved can be meaningful because interest is front-loaded early in a loan, when the balance is highest.</p>

              <p>Behind the scenes, the calculation works like a standard amortization process: each month, interest is computed from the current balance using a monthly interest rate, then your payment is applied first to that interest and the remainder reduces the principal. This repeats until the balance reaches zero. If your payment is too small to cover the monthly interest, the balance will not reduce and the loan will never be paid off under that payment level, so the calculator flags that as an issue. If you enter a first payment date, the payoff date is anchored to that schedule. If you leave it blank, the calculator assumes your first payment happens this month, which is often good enough for planning.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Payments are modeled monthly and interest is calculated monthly using APR ÷ 12 (this is a planning estimate, not a lender statement).</li>
                <li>The “current balance” is treated as the balance right before the next payment is applied.</li>
                <li>Extra monthly payment is added to every payment consistently; one-off lump sums are not modeled here.</li>
                <li>Fees, insurance, taxes, payment holidays, and rate changes are not included unless you reflect them by adjusting the inputs.</li>
                <li>If you leave the first payment date blank, the calculator assumes the schedule starts in the current month.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Does this work for mortgages and home loans?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Mortgages are a common use case. Enter the current outstanding balance, the loan’s interest rate, and your normal monthly payment. If your mortgage rate can change (for example, linked to prime), the result is an estimate based on the rate you enter today.</p>

              <h3>Why does a small extra payment save so much interest?</h3>
              <p>Interest is calculated on the outstanding balance. Early in a loan the balance is high, so reducing principal faster reduces the amount interest can be charged on in future months. Even a modest extra payment, made consistently, can shorten the term and reduce total interest.</p>

              <h3>What if my payment amount changes over time?</h3>
              <p>This calculator assumes a steady monthly payment. If you expect a payment increase, you can re-run the calculation with the higher payment to estimate a new payoff timeline, or test multiple “what if” runs (for example, extra payment starting now versus later).</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know my exact balance or APR?</h3>
              <p>Use your best estimate from a recent statement or online banking. Small differences will move the payoff date slightly, but the direction and size of the effect from extra payments is usually still clear. For a tighter result, update the balance and rate from your latest statement and re-run.</p>

              <h3>Why am I seeing an error about my payment not covering interest?</h3>
              <p>If the monthly payment is less than or equal to the monthly interest, the balance will not reduce. That can happen if you entered a very small payment, a very high interest rate, or an incorrect balance. Increase the payment or confirm the interest rate and balance are correct.</p>

              <h2>Normal distribution percentile calculator for test scores and exam results</h2>

              <p>This calculator estimates where a single score sits on a normal distribution, using the mean and standard deviation for the group. The most common real-world use is exam results: you know your score, you know the average, and you have a standard deviation (or the institution provides it). You want a practical answer to one question: what percentile is my score, roughly, compared to everyone else?</p>

              <p>To use it, enter your score (x), the mean (μ), and the standard deviation (σ). The calculator converts your score into a z-score, which expresses how many standard deviations your score is above or below the mean. From that z-score it estimates the percentile rank, meaning the share of scores expected to be at or below your score if the distribution is normal. You also get the probability of scoring below you and the probability of scoring above you, which are just the same idea shown both ways for clarity.</p>

              <p>The outputs are estimates, not guarantees. They are only as good as the inputs and the assumption that the score distribution is close to normal. In many large classes and standardized tests, the normal approximation is useful for quick comparisons. In small classes, heavily curved marking schemes, or tests with very easy or very hard questions, the distribution may be skewed or capped, and any normal-based percentile will be a rough guide at best.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Your score, the mean, and the standard deviation are measured on the same scale (for example, all are marks out of 100).</li>
                <li>The standard deviation is greater than 0 and represents actual variation in the group, not a placeholder or rounding artifact.</li>
                <li>Scores are treated as approximately normally distributed; strong skew or hard caps reduce accuracy.</li>
                <li>The percentile is interpreted as “at or below this score,” which matches the standard normal CDF approach.</li>
                <li>Results are approximate due to numerical approximation; extreme z-scores will be near 0% or 100% regardless.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What does the z-score mean in plain language?</h3>
              <p>A z-score tells you how far your score is from the average in standard-deviation units. A z-score of 0 means you are exactly at the mean. A z-score of 1.0 means you are one standard deviation above the mean. A z-score of -1.0 means one standard deviation below. This is useful because it makes scores comparable across different tests or cohorts, as long as each has a meaningful mean and standard deviation.</p>

              <h3>Is percentile the same as “my rank”?</h3>
              <p>No. Percentile is a position estimate on a distribution, not a guaranteed class rank. If your percentile is 84th, the model says about 84% of scores are expected to be at or below yours under the normal assumption. Your actual rank depends on the real score distribution and class size. In small classes, rank moves in chunks, and ties are common, so percentile and rank can differ noticeably.</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know the standard deviation?</h3>
              <p>If you do not have σ, you cannot make a defensible normal-based percentile estimate from mean and score alone. Any guess for σ is a guess about spread, and spread is the whole point of converting scores into percentiles. The best move is to get σ from the exam report, lecturer, or dataset. If you only have an approximate range or typical variability, treat the result as a rough scenario, not a fact.</p>

              <h3>Why can the normal estimate be wrong for some exams?</h3>
              <p>Normal distributions are symmetric and unbounded, but exam scores are often bounded (0 to 100) and can be skewed if the exam is too easy or too hard. For example, if many students score near the top, the distribution can bunch up and become left-skewed. In those cases, the normal model can overstate how rare a very high score is, or understate how common a low score is. The estimate is most reliable when the distribution looks roughly bell-shaped and not heavily capped at the extremes.</p>

              <h3>How can I improve accuracy?</h3>
              <p>Use inputs from the same cohort and the same assessment, and use the actual standard deviation, not a rounded or guessed number. If you have access to the score list, the most accurate percentile is empirical: sort scores and compute the proportion at or below. Use the normal approach when you do not have the full list and you need a fast estimate, but do not treat it as authoritative if decisions are high-stakes.</p>

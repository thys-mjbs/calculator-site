              <h2>Pass mark calculator to find the score you need to pass</h2>

              <p>This pass/fail threshold calculator helps you answer a common question: “What do I need on the remaining work to pass?” Whether you are waiting for a final exam, finishing a last assignment, or still working through multiple components, the idea is the same. You already have some marks in the bag, and you want to know the minimum average you must achieve on what is left to reach an overall pass mark.</p>

              <p>The calculator uses three core inputs: your overall pass mark (the final percentage you need), the weight of the course already completed, and your average score across that completed portion. From those values, it calculates the remaining weight (what is still to come) and then computes the required average on the remaining work. If your required average is low or negative, you are already effectively safe. If it is above 100%, passing is mathematically impossible without special rules such as extra credit, moderation, or rounding policies.</p>

              <p>This is designed for normal real-world grading systems where different components contribute different weights to your final result. It works for coursework plus exam structures (for example, 60% coursework and 40% exam), modular assessment structures (for example, multiple tests plus a final), and most weighted-average scenarios. If your situation is points-based, you can still use it by treating “completed weight” as the percentage of the total grade that is locked in and “completed average” as the average score for that locked portion.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Weights are treated as percentages that sum to 100%, with remaining weight calculated as 100% minus completed weight.</li>
                <li>The completed average is assumed to be the weighted average across the completed portion (not a simple average of raw marks unless weights were equal).</li>
                <li>The remaining work is assumed to be scored on the same 0–100% scale as the completed work.</li>
                <li>If the calculated required score is below 0%, the calculator treats this as “already passed” (you can score 0 on the remaining work and still meet the pass mark).</li>
                <li>If the calculated required score is above 100%, the calculator treats this as “not achievable” unless your institution allows extra credit, scaling, or other adjustments.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What does “completed weight” mean?</h3>
              <p>It is the portion of your final grade that has already been assessed and recorded. If coursework counts for 60% and you have finished all coursework, your completed weight is 60%. If you have finished only half of the coursework and the coursework total is 60%, your completed weight might be 30% (because only 30% of the final grade is currently locked in).</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know my exact completed weight?</h3>
              <p>Use a sensible estimate. For example, if you know you have completed “most” of the coursework and the final exam is 40%, set completed weight close to 60%. The calculator will still give you a useful directional answer. If you can later confirm the exact weight, update the number to refine the required score.</p>

              <h3>My required score is negative. What does that mean?</h3>
              <p>It means your current contribution is already high enough that you could score 0% on the remaining work and still meet the pass mark. In practice, you should still aim for a reasonable performance because some courses have additional rules like minimum exam marks, attendance requirements, or component thresholds.</p>

              <h3>My required score is above 100%. Does that mean I have failed?</h3>
              <p>Under a strict weighted-average system, yes. If you need more than 100% on the remaining work to reach the pass mark, passing is not mathematically possible without some form of adjustment. Some institutions allow moderation, scaling, supplementary assessments, or extra credit, so treat this as a strong signal rather than a guarantee if special rules apply.</p>

              <h3>How can I improve accuracy if my course has multiple remaining components?</h3>
              <p>This calculator treats everything remaining as a single “remaining block” and outputs the average you need across it. If you have multiple remaining components with different weights, you can still use the result as a target average. For more detail, calculate the required score for each component by working backwards from your target, or use a separate weighted grade planner where you enter each remaining assessment weight and expected score.</p>

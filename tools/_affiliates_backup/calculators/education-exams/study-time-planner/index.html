              <h2>Study Time Planner for building a realistic exam schedule</h2>

              <p>
                This Study Time Planner is built for one specific decision: how many hours you should study per session and per week to be ready before your exam date, without guessing and without pretending you can study every day. It turns a rough estimate of your total study workload into a simple, actionable plan that you can follow from now until the exam.
              </p>

              <p>
                The dominant use case is straightforward: you know your exam date, you have an idea of how many total hours you need to cover content and practice, and you want a realistic pace that fits into a normal week. This tool is not a task list generator, a timetable builder, or a subject-by-subject planner. It is a pacing calculator that converts “hours needed” into “hours per study day” based on your time window and your weekly availability.
              </p>

              <p>
                To use it, enter your exam date and your total study hours needed. Then enter how many days per week you can actually study. If you are busy, choose a lower number you can keep consistently, not the number you wish were true. Optional settings let you add a buffer percentage for interruptions and cap long study days so the plan stays doable. The result section shows your adjusted total hours, the number of study sessions you likely have, and the target hours per session and per week.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The study window ends the day before the exam date so you are not counting exam day as a full study session.</li>
                <li>If you leave the start date blank, the calculator uses today as the start date.</li>
                <li>Study days are estimated evenly across the calendar (for example, 4 study days per week is treated as roughly 4 out of every 7 days).</li>
                <li>Buffer time increases your total required hours to cover breaks, admin time, slower topics, and revision gaps.</li>
                <li>The “max hours per day” setting is used as a realism check. If your required hours exceed it, the calculator flags the plan as too heavy.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What should I enter for “total study hours needed” if I am not sure?</h3>
              <p>
                Use a defensible estimate, not a perfect one. Start with a number you can justify, such as hours based on how many chapters, lecture blocks, or past papers you need to cover. If you are uncertain, slightly overestimate and add a buffer. The plan is only as good as the workload estimate, but the goal is pacing, not precision.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the calculator ask for “study days per week” instead of a full calendar?</h3>
              <p>
                Because most people do not know their exact schedule for the next few weeks, and forcing a detailed timetable increases friction and reduces usage. This calculator estimates the number of study sessions available by spreading your chosen weekly study days across the time window. If you want more accuracy, you can adjust the inputs conservatively (for example, choose fewer study days per week).
              </p>

              <h3>What does the buffer percentage actually protect me against?</h3>
              <p>
                It protects you against reality. Study time includes setup time, switching topics, slower chapters, unexpected personal disruptions, and revision that takes longer than planned. A small buffer helps prevent a plan that looks fine on paper but collapses after one bad week.
              </p>

              <h3>What if the result says I need more hours per day than I can handle?</h3>
              <p>
                That means your plan is not feasible with your current time window and availability. Your options are practical, not motivational: reduce the scope of what you must cover, increase the number of study days per week, increase the total weeks by starting earlier, or accept a lower target outcome. The calculator cannot create time, it only reveals the gap.
              </p>

              <h3>Does this tool account for different subjects, difficulty levels, or learning speed?</h3>
              <p>
                No. It intentionally does not attempt to micro-plan content. It assumes your “total study hours needed” already reflects your situation. If you want better output, improve that estimate by including practice time, weak-topic time, and at least one full revision pass.
              </p>

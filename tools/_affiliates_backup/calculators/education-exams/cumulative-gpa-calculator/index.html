              <h2>Calculate a cumulative GPA from credits and grades</h2>

              <p>
                A cumulative GPA (grade point average) is usually a weighted average. “Weighted” means
                classes with more credits count more. This Cumulative GPA Calculator helps you compute
                your overall GPA from a list of courses, or update an existing GPA by adding new courses
                from your latest term. You get a clean result plus the key parts behind it: total credits
                and total quality points, so you can sanity-check your numbers.
              </p>

              <p>
                The fastest way to use this calculator is to choose your GPA scale (most people use a
                4.0 scale), then add a few courses. Enter the credits for each course and the grade points
                you received for that course on the selected scale. For example, on a 4.0 scale an A is
                often 4.0, a B is often 3.0, and so on. If you are not sure of the exact conversion at your
                institution, you can still use this calculator as a practical estimate by using the grade
                points shown on your transcript or syllabus.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you already have a cumulative GPA and want to see how new results change it, use the
                “Update an existing cumulative GPA” mode. Enter your total completed credits and, if you
                know it, your current cumulative GPA. Then add the new courses you completed (or expect to
                complete). The calculator combines your prior quality points with your new quality points
                to produce an updated cumulative GPA.
              </p>

              <p>
                The optional planning fields are for people who want a second insight, not just a single
                number. If you enter a target GPA and the number of future credits you still plan to take,
                the calculator estimates the average GPA you would need on those future credits to reach
                the target. This is useful for deciding whether a goal is realistic and what kind of term
                performance you need to aim for.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The calculator assumes GPA is a credit-weighted average: total quality points divided by
                  total credits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grade points must be entered on the same scale you select (4.0, 5.0, 7.0, or 10.0). Mixing
                  scales will give wrong results.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Credits must be positive. If your institution uses “units” or “credit hours,” treat them as
                  credits for weighting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pass/Fail, audit, withdrawals, and non-GPA courses are excluded unless you intentionally
                  include them with appropriate grade points (often 0 or not counted, depending on rules).
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Target GPA” planning assumes future credits will count toward GPA in the same way as past
                  credits and that the scale stays the same.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What is “quality points” and why does it matter?</h3>
              <p>
                Quality points are simply grade points multiplied by credits for a course. A 4-credit class
                at 3.5 grade points contributes 14.0 quality points. Your cumulative GPA is the sum of all
                quality points divided by the sum of all credits. Showing quality points makes it easy to
                verify your inputs and understand which courses affect your GPA the most.
              </p>

              <h3>Do I have to enter every course I have ever taken?</h3>
              <p>
                No. If you want an exact GPA from scratch, entering every course is the most accurate. But if
                you already have a current cumulative GPA and total credits, you can use the update mode and
                only enter new courses. That is usually the quickest and most realistic approach for students.
              </p>

              <h3>My school uses letter grades. What should I enter?</h3>
              <p>
                Enter the grade points equivalent for your institution on your chosen scale. Many systems are
                close to A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0 on a 4.0 scale, but your school may use plus/minus
                values (like 3.7 or 3.3). If you have a transcript, it often lists grade points directly.
              </p>

              <h3>What if a course is pass/fail or doesn’t count toward GPA?</h3>
              <p>
                If the course does not affect GPA at your institution, the cleanest approach is to leave it
                out. If you must include it for some internal reason, you would need to mimic your school’s
                rule, which is typically either “does not count” or “counts as 0 grade points” in some cases.
                This calculator cannot guess your school’s policy, so excluding it is usually safest.
              </p>

              <h3>How accurate is the “required average to hit a target GPA” estimate?</h3>
              <p>
                It is mathematically correct under the assumptions: same scale, future credits count the same
                way, and your target is reachable given the scale maximum. Real life can differ because schools
                may cap repeat credits, treat retakes differently, or exclude certain modules. Use it as a
                planning guide, then confirm with your academic rules if the decision is important.
              </p>

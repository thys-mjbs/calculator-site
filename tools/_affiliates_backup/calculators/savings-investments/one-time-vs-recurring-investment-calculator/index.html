              <h2>One-time vs recurring investment calculator for comparing growth</h2>

              <p>
                This calculator helps you compare two common ways to invest: putting money in once as a lump sum, or investing smaller amounts regularly over time. People search for this comparison when they are deciding whether to invest a windfall today, start a monthly contribution plan, or combine both approaches. The key question is simple: what will each approach likely be worth at the end of your time horizon, given an expected average annual return?
              </p>

              <p>
                The output is designed to be decision-useful, not academic. You get the ending value for a one-time investment, the ending value for recurring contributions, and a clear comparison of the difference. You also see how much you contributed in total and how much of the ending value is growth versus contributed capital. That is important because two strategies can end at similar values while requiring very different cash commitments over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                The calculator supports quick inputs and a more accurate path without forcing complexity. If you only know rough numbers, enter a time horizon and an expected return, then add either a lump sum or recurring amount. If you want a more realistic projection, you can set contribution timing and add an annual increase for contributions. Increasing contributions over time is common when your income grows or when you want contributions to keep up with inflation.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Returns are treated as a steady average rate for the full period; real markets fluctuate and sequence of returns can change outcomes.</li>
                <li>Compounding is assumed to match the contribution frequency (monthly, weekly, or annual) for a consistent comparison.</li>
                <li>Taxes, fees, platform charges, and account limits are not included; these can materially reduce real-world results.</li>
                <li>If you choose “beginning of period,” contributions are assumed to be invested immediately in that period, which increases the ending value.</li>
                <li>If you use an annual increase for contributions, it is applied smoothly across periods using a per-period growth rate derived from the annual percentage.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Which is better: investing a lump sum or investing monthly?</h3>
              <p>
                “Better” depends on what problem you are solving. If you already have the money available, a lump sum generally has more time in the market and can produce a higher ending value at the same return rate. Recurring investing is often easier to sustain and reduces timing risk because you are spreading purchases over time. This calculator shows the trade-off in a way that makes the timing and cash commitment obvious.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the contribution timing setting matter?</h3>
              <p>
                End-of-period contributions assume you invest after the period’s growth. Beginning-of-period contributions assume you invest before that growth. Over many periods, that extra compounding can create a meaningful difference. If you contribute via debit order at the start of each month, “beginning” may be closer to reality.
              </p>

              <h3>What does “investment growth” mean in the results?</h3>
              <p>
                Investment growth is the ending value minus total contributed capital for that strategy. It is a practical way to see how much of the outcome came from market returns versus your own cash contributions. If growth is small relative to contributions, the time horizon may be too short, the return assumption may be conservative, or the contribution plan may be doing most of the work.
              </p>

              <h3>What if I only have one of the inputs, lump sum or recurring amount?</h3>
              <p>
                That is normal. You can enter only a lump sum to see what it could grow to, or enter only a recurring amount to see the impact of consistent contributions. The comparison still works because both paths are calculated independently. If you enter both, you get a fuller picture of how a mixed approach performs.
              </p>

              <h3>How can I make the result more realistic without making it complicated?</h3>
              <p>
                Start by using a reasonable expected return (often lower than the best historical periods), pick the correct frequency for how you really contribute, and use an annual contribution increase if your contributions typically grow over time. If you want to be conservative, reduce the expected return to account for fees and taxes, or shorten the horizon to see a downside scenario.
              </p>

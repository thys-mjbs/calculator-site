              <h2>Extra payment impact calculator for loan payoff and interest savings</h2>

              <p>This extra payment impact calculator shows what happens when you pay more than the required monthly loan payment. If you are trying to get out of debt faster, the key questions are usually practical: how many months sooner will the loan end, how much interest will you avoid, and what monthly budget increase does it actually require. This tool answers those questions by comparing your original loan schedule to a second schedule that includes your extra payments.</p>

              <p>You start by entering the loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan term in years. The calculator estimates the standard monthly payment that would fully pay off the loan over that term. Then you can add either a monthly extra payment, a one time lump sum payment, or both. Monthly extra payments are treated as additional principal reduction after interest is applied each month. Lump sums are treated as a single extra principal payment in the month you choose. The result is a faster payoff and usually a large interest saving.</p>

              <p>Why this matters is that interest cost is driven by both rate and time. Even a modest extra monthly payment can shave off a surprising number of months because it reduces the balance earlier, which reduces future interest. The calculator shows the baseline payoff time and total interest, then shows the accelerated payoff time and total interest with extra payments. The difference between those two scenarios is the “impact” you care about: time saved, interest saved, and total payments avoided.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Interest is calculated monthly using the annual rate divided by 12, and applied to the remaining balance at the start of each month.</li>
                <li>Your standard payment is calculated to fully repay the loan over the term you entered (unless the rate is 0%, in which case it is principal divided by months).</li>
                <li>Extra payments are applied after the standard payment each month and reduce principal directly, which is typical for many loans but not all products.</li>
                <li>If you leave optional fields blank, the calculator assumes no extra payment, and it still produces a valid baseline schedule and payment.</li>
                <li>Fees, penalties, redraw rules, and changes in interest rate are not included. If your loan has these, use the results as a directional estimate.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Do extra payments always reduce the total interest I pay?</h3>
              <p>Usually yes, because you reduce the balance earlier, which reduces the interest charged in future months. However, some products have fees, early settlement penalties, or different rules for how extra payments are applied. If your lender treats extra payments as “prepaid installments” instead of principal reduction, the interest benefit may be smaller. Use this calculator as a baseline and confirm your loan’s rules.</p>

              <h3>What if I do not know the exact interest rate or term?</h3>
              <p>You can still get a useful estimate. Enter your best guess for the annual interest rate and the remaining term. If you are unsure, run two quick scenarios, one slightly lower and one slightly higher interest rate. If the conclusion stays similar across both, you have a robust decision. The calculator is designed so missing optional inputs do not block you from getting results.</p>

              <h3>Is it better to pay a monthly extra amount or a lump sum?</h3>
              <p>Earlier is typically better. A lump sum paid sooner can reduce interest more than the same amount spread out later, because the balance is reduced for more months. But real budgets matter. If you cannot reliably do a monthly extra payment, a lump sum at bonus time can still be powerful. Use the calculator to compare “monthly extra” versus “lump sum in month X” and see which outcome fits your cash flow.</p>

              <h3>What does “months saved” actually mean?</h3>
              <p>It is the difference between the baseline payoff length and the accelerated payoff length. For example, if the baseline schedule is 60 months and the accelerated schedule is 49 months, you saved 11 months. This is not a guarantee of a specific calendar date because payment dates vary by lender, but it is a clear measure of how much sooner the balance reaches zero under the same interest assumptions.</p>

              <h3>When might this calculator not apply?</h3>
              <p>If your rate changes over time (variable rate), if your loan has balloon payments, if your repayment frequency is not monthly, or if the lender uses unusual allocation rules, your real schedule can differ. The calculator is still useful for planning, but for exact figures you should compare the output to a lender statement or an amortization schedule that matches your loan’s specific terms.</p>

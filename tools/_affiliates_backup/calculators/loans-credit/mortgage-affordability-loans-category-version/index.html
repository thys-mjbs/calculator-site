              <h2>
                Mortgage affordability calculator for “how much house can I afford?”
              </h2>

              <p>
                This calculator estimates the maximum home price you can afford
                using a practical lending-style approach. It converts your monthly
                income and debt obligations into a maximum housing budget, then
                translates that budget into an estimated loan amount and home
                purchase price based on your interest rate and term.
              </p>

              <p>
                The dominant use case is simple: you want a realistic upper limit
                before you browse listings, speak to an agent, or apply for a
                mortgage. The output is not a quote from a bank and it is not
                tailored underwriting. It is a fast, defensible estimate you can
                use to set a search range and avoid wasting time on homes that are
                obviously out of reach.
              </p>

              <p>
                To use it, enter your gross monthly income and your required monthly
                debt payments (car loans, credit cards, personal loans, student
                loans, and any other fixed commitments). Then enter your down
                payment, interest rate, and loan term. If you know them, add
                property tax, insurance, and any HOA or levies. Those optional costs
                matter because lenders and your own budget must cover the total
                monthly housing payment, not only the mortgage principal and
                interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                The calculator first estimates a maximum total housing payment using
                two common constraints: a housing ratio limit (front-end) and a total
                debt-to-income limit (back-end DTI). The housing ratio caps the
                housing payment as a percentage of gross income. The DTI cap limits
                total debt payments (housing plus other debts). The tighter of the
                two becomes your maximum total housing payment. From there, the
                calculator subtracts monthly taxes, insurance, and HOA costs to find
                the maximum principal-and-interest payment. Finally, it solves the
                standard mortgage payment formula in reverse to estimate the maximum
                loan amount and home price.
              </p>

              <p>
                The primary results are the maximum affordable home price and the
                maximum loan amount. Supporting figures show the maximum allowed
                total housing payment, the portion reserved for taxes, insurance, and
                HOA, and the maximum principal-and-interest payment the mortgage
                itself can use. If the optional costs are high, your maximum loan
                amount can drop sharply even if your income is strong.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Gross monthly income is used because many lending guidelines are
                  expressed on a gross basis, even though your real budget is net of
                  taxes and payroll deductions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The default housing ratio limit is 28% and the default back-end DTI
                  limit is 36%. These are common rule-of-thumb limits, not a promise
                  that every lender will use them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Property tax and homeowners insurance are treated as monthly costs
                  (annual values divided by 12). If you leave them blank, they are
                  assumed to be 0, which will overstate affordability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The result assumes a fixed-rate, fully amortizing mortgage over the
                  full term. It does not model adjustable rates, interest-only
                  periods, balloon loans, or changing payments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The home price estimate assumes your down payment is available as
                  cash and does not include closing costs, prepaid escrow items, or
                  lender fees, which can reduce what you can actually buy.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Why does adding property tax or insurance reduce the home price so much?</h3>
              <p>
                Because lenders and your budget care about the total monthly housing
                payment. If taxes and insurance take a larger slice of the allowed
                housing payment, there is less room for the mortgage principal and
                interest. The loan amount is driven by that principal-and-interest
                payment, so the maximum loan can fall quickly.
              </p>

              <h3>Should I use gross income or take-home pay?</h3>
              <p>
                This calculator uses gross income to match common lending ratios.
                That is useful for “can I qualify” estimates. For “can I live with
                this payment,” you should also sanity-check using your take-home pay
                and a real monthly budget. If your deductions are high, the gross
                ratio limits can still produce an uncomfortable payment.
              </p>

              <h3>What counts as monthly debt payments?</h3>
              <p>
                Use the minimum required payments you must make each month: loan
                instalments, required credit card minimums, maintenance obligations,
                or any fixed commitments that reduce your borrowing capacity. Do not
                include discretionary spending like groceries or fuel; those belong
                in your personal budget, not the lender-style DTI calculation.
              </p>

              <h3>What interest rate should I enter if I am not pre-approved?</h3>
              <p>
                Use a realistic rate you expect to qualify for today, and run a
                second calculation with a higher rate as a stress test. Even a small
                rate increase can materially reduce the maximum loan amount, because
                the same monthly payment supports less principal when interest costs
                are higher.
              </p>

              <h3>Does this calculator tell me the “right” home price to buy?</h3>
              <p>
                No. It estimates an upper limit based on income and debt ratios. The
                “right” price depends on your lifestyle, savings rate, emergency
                fund, job stability, and tolerance for payment risk. If the maximum
                output feels tight, treat it as a ceiling and aim below it.

              <h2>Credit score improvement impact on loan payments and interest</h2>

              <p>This calculator helps you estimate what a better credit score can mean in money terms. In most lending systems, lenders price risk. If your score improves, you may qualify for a lower interest rate, better repayment terms, or both. Even a small change in APR can materially change your monthly payment and the total interest you pay over the full term.</p>

              <p>You can use this tool in two practical ways. If you already know the interest rate you can get after improving your credit, choose the option to enter the improved APR directly. That gives you a clean before and after comparison with no extra assumptions. If you do not know the improved rate yet, choose the option to estimate a rate drop. In that mode, you enter your current APR and an estimated reduction in percentage points, and the calculator will infer an improved APR and show the impact.</p>

              <p>The results are designed to be scannable and decision-ready. You will see the current monthly payment, the improved monthly payment, and the difference. You will also see the total interest paid in each scenario and the total interest saved. This matters because credit improvements usually take time. The calculator lets you sanity-check whether the potential savings are large enough to justify actions like paying down balances, correcting credit report errors, or delaying a loan until your profile improves.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This tool models a standard amortizing loan with a fixed interest rate and equal monthly payments.</li>
                <li>Interest rates are entered as APR percentages and converted to a monthly rate for the payment calculation.</li>
                <li>In estimate mode, the improved APR equals current APR minus your entered rate drop, capped at 0%.</li>
                <li>Fees, insurance, taxes, penalties, and variable-rate changes are not included unless they are already baked into the APR values you enter.</li>
                <li>Your lender’s pricing may differ by country, product type, collateral, income, and policy. Treat estimates as directional, not guaranteed quotes.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>Do I need to enter my credit score to get a result?</h3>
              <p>No. The calculation is driven by interest rates, not by the score itself. The optional credit score increase field is there to help you document what you are aiming for, but it does not change the math. What matters is the APR you have now and the APR you expect after improvement.</p>

              <h3>What does “rate drop in percentage points” mean?</h3>
              <p>If your APR goes from 18.5% to 16.5%, that is a 2.0 percentage point drop. It is not a 2% reduction of the rate. Use the absolute difference between rates.</p>

              <h3>Why does the monthly savings look small but total savings look large?</h3>
              <p>Loan interest is paid over time. A small monthly difference can accumulate into a meaningful total across dozens of payments. Total interest saved is often the better metric for comparing scenarios, especially on longer terms.</p>

              <h3>What if my improved APR is higher than my current APR?</h3>
              <p>The calculator will still compute the numbers, but the result will show negative savings, meaning higher cost. This can happen if market rates rise, your loan type changes, or your lender’s pricing shifts. Use the tool to see the trade-off clearly.</p>

              <h3>When is this calculator not a good fit?</h3>
              <p>If your loan has a variable rate, balloon payments, interest-only periods, or irregular repayment schedules, a basic amortization model will not match the real repayment path. In those cases, use lender quotes, a refinance-specific calculator, or the exact amortization schedule from the lender.</p>

              <h2>Weekly work hours and overtime calculator for timesheets and planning</h2>

              <p>This weekly work hours calculator helps you add up the hours you worked across the week and turn that into a clear, practical summary. People usually need this for timesheets, payroll checks, estimating overtime, planning workload, or simply tracking how much time work is taking from their week. Instead of doing mental math across seven days, you enter the daily hours and get totals instantly.</p>

              <p>The calculator is designed for normal, imperfect data. If you only know rough hours for a day, you can still enter them. If you did not work on a day, leave it blank or enter 0. You can also subtract unpaid break time using a single setting that applies to each day you actually worked, which is a common timesheet requirement.</p>

              <p>Your results include total weekly hours, how many days you worked, your average hours per worked day, and your overtime hours beyond a weekly threshold you choose. The default overtime threshold most people use is 40 hours per week, but different workplaces and countries use different rules. That is why the threshold is editable. This calculator focuses on hours only, not pay, because pay rules vary widely and can create misleading outputs if assumed.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Daily inputs are treated as hours worked for that day (for example, 7.5 means seven and a half hours).</li>
                <li>If you enter unpaid break minutes, the calculator subtracts that amount once per day only for days with more than 0 hours.</li>
                <li>If break subtraction would make a day negative, that day is treated as 0 hours after breaks.</li>
                <li>The overtime threshold is weekly and is applied after adding all adjusted daily hours (after breaks, if used).</li>
                <li>This tool does not model legal overtime rules, daily overtime, weekend multipliers, or public holiday rules. It only splits total weekly hours into regular and overtime based on your threshold.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What should I enter if I do not know my exact hours?</h3>
              <p>Enter your best estimate for each day. This calculator is still useful with rough numbers because it shows the weekly total and highlights whether you are near or above your overtime threshold. If you later get exact timesheets, re-run the calculation with the updated hours.</p>

              <h3>How does the break minutes option work?</h3>
              <p>If you enter break minutes, the calculator subtracts that amount from each day you worked. For example, if you enter 30 minutes and you worked 8 hours on Monday, the adjusted Monday value becomes 7.5 hours. If you did not work on a day, no break is subtracted for that day.</p>

              <h3>What if my overtime rules are different from 40 hours per week?</h3>
              <p>Change the overtime threshold to match your situation. Some contracts use 37.5, 38, 45, or another number. This calculator will then show regular hours up to that threshold and overtime beyond it. If your workplace uses daily overtime or special weekend rules, treat the overtime result as an estimate and verify against your policy.</p>

              <h3>Can I use this for rotating shifts or split shifts?</h3>
              <p>Yes, as long as you can convert each day into a total hours figure. If you worked two shifts in a day, add them together and enter the combined hours for that day. If you took breaks between shifts that are unpaid, you can either subtract them manually from the day’s total or use the break minutes option if the same break amount applies each worked day.</p>

              <h3>Why does the calculator show “average per worked day” instead of per calendar day?</h3>
              <p>Most people want to know how long their workdays are on the days they actually worked. That makes the number more meaningful than spreading hours across seven calendar days, especially for part-time schedules or weekend work. The calculator also shows how many days were counted as worked so the average is transparent.</p>

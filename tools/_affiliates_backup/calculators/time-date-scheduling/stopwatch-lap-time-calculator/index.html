              <h2>Calculate lap time from stopwatch totals and splits</h2>

              <p>
                This Stopwatch Lap Time Calculator is built for one common situation: you used a stopwatch during a run,
                swim, track session, or any repetitive task, and you want a clear average lap time that you can actually
                use. Most people do not want a spreadsheet. They want a reliable split time that tells them what each lap
                took, plus a few quick signals about whether the effort was consistent.
              </p>

              <p>
                The default workflow is simple. Enter your total elapsed time and the number of laps you completed. The
                calculator returns your average lap time and a couple of supporting figures that help you make a decision,
                like what a set number of laps would take at the same pace. This is useful for planning interval sessions,
                checking whether you hit a target pace, or translating a messy stopwatch total into a clean per-lap number.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you have lap splits from your stopwatch, you can paste them instead. When you provide splits, the
                calculator ignores the total and lap count and uses the splits as the source of truth. That unlocks extra
                outputs: fastest lap, slowest lap, the spread between them, and a simple consistency score. These are the
                numbers people usually care about when they are comparing efforts or trying to tighten pacing.
              </p>

              <h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Time formats accepted are hh:mm:ss, mm:ss, or plain seconds. If you enter a colon format, minutes and
                  seconds are treated as clock-style values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you enter lap splits, they override the total elapsed time and lap count. This prevents double
                  counting or conflicts between two sources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Average lap time is calculated as total time divided by number of laps. This assumes laps are equal
                  distance or equal units of work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The consistency score is based on variation between lap splits. It is meant as a quick indicator, not a
                  clinical metric.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The target-laps projection assumes you can maintain the same average lap time. Real performance usually
                  changes with fatigue, terrain, and pacing strategy.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common questions</h3>

              <h3>What should I enter if my stopwatch shows minutes and seconds?</h3>
              <p>
                Use mm:ss, for example 12:34. If your stopwatch shows hours as well, use hh:mm:ss, for example 1:02:15.
                If you only know seconds, enter a plain number like 754.2. The calculator interprets the format you type.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the result change when I paste lap splits?</h3>
              <p>
                Because splits are more specific than a total. If your stopwatch total includes pauses, reaction time, or
                a warm-up segment, the average from total time and lap count may be misleading. Using splits typically
                gives a cleaner picture of what each lap took, especially if you recorded laps intentionally during the
                effort.
              </p>

              <h3>Can I use this for anything besides sport laps?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, as long as you are timing repeated units. Examples include warehouse pick cycles, repeated machine
                runs, or practice drills. The only requirement is that each lap represents the same unit of work. If your
                laps are different distances or different tasks, the “average lap time” is still a valid average, but it
                stops being a fair pacing comparison.
              </p>

              <h3>My lap splits are inconsistent. What does the consistency score mean?</h3>
              <p>
                The score summarizes how tightly your lap times cluster around your average. A low variation means you
                paced evenly. A higher variation means your laps changed a lot, often from starting too fast, fatigue, or
                external factors like traffic or turns. Use it as a diagnostic signal, not a pass or fail label.
              </p>

              <h3>How do I get a more accurate projection for a longer target?</h3>
              <p>
                The simple projection assumes your average stays the same. If you want a more realistic forecast, record
                splits for the full session, or at least for the final third when fatigue shows up. Then use the splits
                mode to inspect whether you slow down over time. If your later splits drift, your long-target projection
                should be based on those later splits, not your early pace.
              </p>

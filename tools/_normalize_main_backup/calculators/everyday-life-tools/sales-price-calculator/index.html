<h2>Sales Price Calculator for discounts, tax, and totals</h2>
<p>When you are comparing prices, the “sale” tag is only part of the story. A discount can be shown as a percentage, a fixed amount, or sometimes both. Then tax may be added at checkout, and buying more than one item changes the total quickly. This Sales Price Calculator helps you turn those moving parts into a clear final number you can trust before you pay.</p>
<p>Use this calculator to work out the discounted price per item, the amount you save, the tax amount, and the final total. It is built to work even if you do not have every detail. If you only know the list price, you can still get a useful answer. If you know the discount and tax, you can refine it and see the exact checkout-style result.</p>
<p>Start by entering the list price for one item. Then add either a discount percent or a discount amount. If you add both, the calculator treats the percent as the main discount because that is how most promotions are advertised and applied. Add a tax rate if tax is charged on the discounted price where you are shopping. Finally, enter quantity if you are buying multiple items so you can see the total cost and the effective per-item cost.</p>
<p>The result section shows a practical breakdown. You will see the discount applied per item, the sale price before tax, the tax amount per item, and the final price per item. If you add quantity, you also get subtotal, total tax, and the total amount payable. This makes it easier to decide if a promotion is actually good, compare two stores, or check whether you are staying within a budget.</p>
<p>In real life, discount and tax rules vary by store and region. Some places apply tax after discounts, while others have fees, shipping, or rounding rules at checkout. This calculator keeps the logic simple and transparent so you can get a fast, defensible estimate and adjust inputs if your receipt works differently.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discount percent and discount amount are both optional. If both are entered, the percent is used to calculate the discount.</li>
<li>Tax is applied to the discounted price (sale price before tax), which is the most common checkout approach.</li>
<li>Quantity defaults to 1 if left blank, so you can get a per-item result without extra steps.</li>
<li>Values are treated as currency-like numbers and results are displayed to two decimals for readability.</li>
<li>Shipping, service fees, coupons stacking rules, and store-specific rounding are not included unless you model them by adjusting the inputs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>Should I use discount percent or discount amount?</h3>
<p>Use whichever you actually have. If the deal says “20% off,” enter the percent. If it says “save $50,” enter the amount. If you enter both, percent is used so the discount scales correctly with the list price.</p>
<h3>What if the discount amount is bigger than the list price?</h3>
<p>That is not a realistic sale price scenario. The calculator will ask you to correct it because a discount cannot reduce a price below zero in normal retail pricing.</p>
<h3>Does tax apply before or after the discount?</h3>
<p>This calculator applies tax after the discount, on the sale price before tax. If your receipt shows tax calculated differently, adjust by setting tax to zero and treating the difference as part of the discount or price so you can still compare totals.</p>
<h3>What if I do not know the tax rate?</h3>
<p>Leave tax blank to get a pre-tax sale price. If you want a closer estimate, use a typical local rate you have seen on receipts. The breakdown will still show your savings and discounted price clearly.</p>
<h3>How can I compare two deals quickly?</h3>
<p>Run each deal with the same quantity and tax assumptions, then compare the final total and savings. This works well for “percent off” versus “fixed amount off” promotions because it converts both into the same final price.</p>

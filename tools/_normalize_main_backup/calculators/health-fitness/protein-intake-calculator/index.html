<h2>Protein intake calculator for daily grams and per-meal targets</h2>
<p>This protein intake calculator estimates a practical daily protein range based on your body weight, your goal (maintenance, fat loss, or muscle gain), and how active you are. Instead of giving you one single number that looks precise but is easy to miss in real life, it gives you a minimum and maximum. That range is more realistic because protein needs vary with training volume, calorie intake, appetite, and how lean you are.</p>
<p>To use it quickly, enter your weight and pick your goal. If you train regularly, set your activity level to “very active.” If you are mostly sedentary, select that option and the calculator will choose a lower but still sensible range. If you know your body fat percentage, you can add it as an optional input. When body fat is provided, the calculator can estimate your lean body mass and base the target on lean mass, which often makes the result more reasonable for people carrying a higher amount of body fat.</p>
<p>Your result includes your daily protein range in grams, plus an easy per-meal breakdown for common meal patterns. This helps you turn a daily target into something you can execute. If you struggle to eat enough protein, use the per-meal number as your “minimum per meal” guideline. If you already eat high protein, the top end of the range is a ceiling for most people, not a requirement.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Protein targets are shown as a range (minimum to maximum) because real needs vary with training, energy intake, and individual response.</li>
<li>Activity level is treated as a proxy for strength training frequency and overall demand, not step count or cardio alone.</li>
<li>If body fat percentage is provided, lean body mass is estimated as body weight × (1 − body fat %), and targets may be based on lean mass for better realism.</li>
<li>This tool focuses on daily grams of protein, not total calories or macro ratios. You can pair it with a calorie deficit or surplus calculator if needed.</li>
<li>Medical conditions (kidney disease, pregnancy, clinical nutrition needs) are out of scope. If you have one of these, use professional guidance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>Why is the result a range instead of one number?</h3>
<p>A single number suggests a level of precision you cannot actually hit consistently. Protein needs depend on training volume, body size, diet phase, and how lean you are. A range lets you aim for a clear minimum while giving you a safe upper boundary that covers most real-world cases.</p>
<h3>Do I need more protein when cutting (fat loss)?</h3>
<p>Often, yes. When calories are lower, your body has less energy available and protein becomes more important for maintaining muscle. That is why the fat loss option typically shifts the range upward. The practical goal is to keep performance and recovery stable while losing fat.</p>
<h3>What if I do not know my body fat percentage?</h3>
<p>Leave it blank. The calculator will base the estimate on total body weight, which is still useful for most people. If you want to improve accuracy later, use a consistent measurement method (calipers, a reliable scanner, or repeatable tape measurements), then update the optional body fat field.</p>
<h3>Is higher protein always better for muscle gain?</h3>
<p>No. Past a certain point, increasing protein further usually gives diminishing returns compared with improving training quality, total calories, and sleep. The upper end of the range is a practical ceiling for most users. If you consistently hit the minimum to middle of the range and your training is progressive, you are already covering the main benefit.</p>
<h3>How should I spread protein across meals?</h3>
<p>Most people do better spreading protein across the day rather than eating it all in one meal. Use the per-meal target as a simple execution rule. If you eat three meals, aim to hit your minimum per meal three times. If you snack or have four meals, the per-meal target will be lower and often easier to achieve.</p>

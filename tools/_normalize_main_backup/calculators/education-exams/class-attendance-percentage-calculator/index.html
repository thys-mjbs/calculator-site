                Class attendance percentage calculator for meeting minimum
                attendance rules
              </h2>
<p>
                Many schools, colleges, and training programs require a minimum
                attendance percentage before you can sit for exams, submit final
                assessments, or receive course credit. The problem is that
                attendance is easy to misjudge when you are counting weeks,
                holidays, cancellations, and partial attendance. This calculator
                is built for one decision: checking whether you meet a required
                attendance threshold and what you need to do next to stay above
                it.
              </p>
<p>
                In the default view, you only enter two numbers: how many
                classes you have attended and how many classes have been held so
                far. The calculator then shows your current attendance
                percentage, the gap to a typical minimum requirement, and a
                clear status message. If you want a more realistic estimate for
                your institution, you can add a required minimum percentage and
                the total number of classes in the term, and the calculator will
                estimate how many future classes you can miss or must attend to
                finish the term above your target.
              </p>
<p>
                The advanced options exist for common edge cases. Some
                institutions treat excused absences differently, so you can
                optionally enter excused absences to view an adjusted
                attendance figure that removes excused sessions from the
                denominator. This does not replace your institution’s official
                policy, but it helps you sanity check both ways of calculating
                attendance when you are unsure how they record medical leave,
                approved events, or official exemptions.
              </p>
<h3>Assumptions and how to use this calculator</h3>
<ul>
<li>
                  “Classes held so far” means sessions that actually took place.
                  Do not include cancelled classes that were never run.
                </li>
<li>
                  “Classes attended so far” means you were present for the
                  session. If your institution records partial attendance, you
                  should convert it to your best whole number estimate.
                </li>
<li>
                  If you enter excused absences, the calculator shows an
                  additional “adjusted” percentage using held minus excused as
                  the denominator. If your institution does not exclude excused
                  absences, ignore the adjusted line.
                </li>
<li>
                  If you enter a required attendance percent, the calculator
                  compares your current percentage to that target and tells you
                  whether you currently meet it.
                </li>
<li>
                  If you enter total classes in term, the calculator assumes
                  future classes will be counted normally and estimates how many
                  you can still miss or must attend from today to finish above
                  the requirement.
                </li>
</ul>
<h3>Common questions</h3>
<h3>What is the attendance percentage formula?</h3>
<p>
                The basic formula is attendance percentage equals classes
                attended divided by classes held, multiplied by one hundred. For
                example, 18 attended out of 24 held is 75%. If you use excused
                absences, the adjusted version divides attended by held minus
                excused, then multiplies by one hundred.
              </p>
<h3>What if I do not know the total classes in the term?</h3>
<p>
                You can still get a useful answer. Leave total term classes
                blank and use the calculator to check your current percentage.
                The “how many can I miss” planning output depends on knowing how
                many classes remain, so it is only shown when you provide a
                total term number.
              </p>
<h3>Why does the calculator warn if attended is higher than held?</h3>
<p>
                Attendance cannot exceed classes held. If you see that warning,
                one of your numbers is wrong. The most common mistake is
                entering scheduled classes instead of classes that actually took
                place, or counting excused sessions as attended.
              </p>
<h3>Do excused absences count against attendance?</h3>
<p>
                Policies vary. Some institutions count excused absences as
                absences, some exclude them from the calculation, and some use a
                separate “condoned” category with limits. This calculator shows
                an optional adjusted percentage so you can understand the impact
                if excused sessions are excluded. For official decisions, match
                your institution’s policy.
              </p>
<h3>How accurate is the “classes I can miss” result?</h3>
<p>
                It is accurate for the assumptions used: future classes are
                counted normally, and the requirement is a simple percentage of
                total counted classes. If your institution uses weighted
                attendance, different rules for labs versus lectures, or caps on
                condoned absences, the planning result can be directionally
                useful but not official. The safest use is as a planning guide,
                then confirm with your course administrator if you are close to
                the cutoff.

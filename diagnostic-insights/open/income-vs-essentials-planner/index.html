              <h2>Income vs essential expenses readiness diagnostic</h2>

              <p>The Income vs Essentials diagnostic answers one practical question: does monthly income reliably cover core expenses that must be paid to keep life stable. This is not a motivational budget worksheet. It is a structure check. If essentials are higher than income, the issue is not willpower. The issue is math. If income covers essentials only narrowly, stability becomes fragile because one missed shift, one delayed payment, or one small surprise forces trade-offs. If income covers essentials with margin, the baseline becomes stable and planning becomes possible.</p>

              <p>This page is designed for people who want clarity without building a full budget first. Many budgets fail because the person starts with categories that are not essential, or mixes discretionary spending into essentials, or forgets required minimum payments. The result is a budget that looks reasonable on paper but still collapses under basic monthly reality. The readiness ratio used here forces a single constraint. Essentials have to be funded first. The ratio is simply income divided by total essentials. It is easy to calculate, and it immediately exposes whether the baseline is viable.</p>

              <p>When you use this diagnostic, treat the inputs as monthly averages. If your expenses vary seasonally, choose a normal month, then sanity check the result using a heavy month. The output classification is not a judgment. It is a signal. Underprepared means essentials exceed income. Borderline means essentials are covered but the margin is small. Stable means essentials are covered with buffer. The exact thresholds are intentionally simple because the purpose is baseline structure, not a full financial plan.</p>

              <h3>How the readiness ratio works</h3>
              <p>The readiness ratio is income divided by total essentials. A ratio below 1.00 means income does not cover essentials. A ratio around 1.00 means you are covering essentials but only just. As the ratio rises, your buffer increases. Buffer is what stops your month from becoming a series of micro-crises. Buffer is also what makes saving possible. If you have no margin, any plan that depends on saving is not a plan. It is a wish.</p>

              <p>Essentials in this diagnostic are the costs that keep your baseline functioning. They include housing, utilities, food, transport, and minimum required debt repayments. You can include other unavoidable items if they truly are mandatory, but the point is to stay strict. If you load essentials with discretionary spending, the ratio becomes less meaningful. If you exclude required minimum payments, the ratio becomes a lie.</p>

              <p>The diagnostic does not assess shocks or future commitments. It does not attempt to model medical events, job loss, emergencies, or large future purchases. That is deliberate. This is a baseline structure check. The output is still useful because if the baseline is already failing, shock modelling is irrelevant. A system that fails in normal conditions will fail harder under stress.</p>

              <h3>What each classification means</h3>
              <p>Underprepared means total essentials are higher than monthly income. That typically means you are either financing essentials with debt, falling behind, or relying on irregular support. In this state, your month is mathematically unstable. Small changes do not fix it. You need a correction move that either increases income, reduces essentials, or both. The purpose is not to cut everything. The purpose is to close the essentials gap first.</p>

              <p>Borderline means income covers essentials, but the buffer is small. Borderline is where people often feel like they are doing everything right but still cannot get ahead. The reason is that the baseline is using nearly all available income. Any surprise cost eats the buffer. In borderline, discipline matters, but structure matters more. You want margin. Margin is created through a mix of targeted essentials reductions and targeted income improvements. Random cutting usually fails because it is not targeted at the biggest drivers.</p>

              <p>Stable means income covers essentials with meaningful margin. Stable does not mean wealthy. It means the baseline has slack. Slack is what allows savings, better decisions, and fewer forced trade-offs. In stable, your priorities shift. You can focus on building resilience, reducing high-cost debt faster, and making plans that require consistency. Stability can still be lost if essentials creep upward or income drops. That is why the ratio is useful as a recurring check.</p>

              <h3>Assumptions and limitations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This diagnostic uses monthly averages and assumes expenses are broadly consistent across the month.</li>
                <li>Income is treated as net income available for expenses, not gross pay.</li>
                <li>Essentials are limited to baseline survival and required minimum obligations, not discretionary spending.</li>
                <li>This diagnostic does not model irregular income, seasonal costs, or short-term shocks.</li>
                <li>This diagnostic is a baseline structure check, not a full budget, financial plan, or advice service.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Common mistakes that break the signal</h3>
              <p>One common mistake is underestimating housing. People enter rent or bond but forget mandatory fees, levies, and unavoidable basics that are effectively part of housing. Another mistake is treating discretionary transport as essential. If you can remove trips without impacting your ability to work, that portion is not essential. A third mistake is excluding debt minimums. If minimum repayments are required to avoid default or penalties, they are essential whether you like them or not.</p>

              <p>Another error is using a best month. If you choose a month with low utilities, low transport, or low food spending, the ratio can look stable when the system is actually borderline. If your costs fluctuate, either use a heavy month or compute a rough average. The purpose is to see the baseline as it really is, not as you wish it to be.</p>

              <p>Finally, many people treat income as what they intend to earn rather than what actually arrives. If you have variable income, use a conservative monthly average. Otherwise you can create a false stable result that disappears when income dips. If income is genuinely irregular, this diagnostic is still useful, but you should run it using a low income month and a typical income month to see how quickly the baseline breaks.</p>

              <h3>How to improve the ratio without guessing</h3>
              <p>Improving the ratio is not about cutting everything. It is about moving the biggest levers. Essentials usually have one or two dominant drivers. Housing is frequently the largest. Transport can also be large, especially when vehicle finance, fuel, and insurance are combined. Debt minimums can become a hidden driver because interest and minimums lock you into required payments.</p>

              <p>Start by identifying which essential categories are the largest contributors. The diagnostic includes a simple driver list so you can see where the mass is. If housing is the largest driver, you can run specific scenarios. What happens if housing drops by 10 percent. What happens if income rises by a fixed amount. You can do these scenarios with small changes and see whether they materially shift classification. If a change does not move the needle, it is not a primary lever.</p>

              <p>For underprepared outcomes, you need a correction threshold that closes the gap. The gap is essentials minus income. Closing it can come from income, essentials reductions, or both. For borderline outcomes, you are not closing a gap, you are creating margin. Margin is the difference between income and essentials. A healthy margin is not arbitrary. It is the amount that prevents routine volatility from breaking the month.</p>

              <h3>How to interpret the two immediate actions</h3>
              <p>The on-page output always gives exactly two immediate actions. These are not a full plan. They are the two next moves that are most likely to change the baseline quickly. One action is typically about the largest essentials driver. The second action is typically about a correction move that increases margin. These actions are intentionally simple because the free page does not replace the paid planner.</p>

              <p>If you are underprepared, the immediate actions aim to stop ongoing instability. That usually means quantifying the essentials gap and picking one correction lever to close it. If you are borderline, the immediate actions aim to protect the month from small shocks by creating buffer. If you are stable, the immediate actions aim to maintain stability and improve resilience over time.</p>

              <h3>Who this diagnostic is for</h3>
              <p>This diagnostic is for anyone who pays monthly living costs and wants to know if their baseline structure is viable. It is especially useful if you feel like you earn money but it disappears quickly, or if you feel you cannot save despite trying, or if you are considering taking on additional commitments and want to know whether you have slack.</p>

              <p>It is not for detailed cash flow management, investment planning, or complex household budgeting with many categories. If you need that, this diagnostic still helps because it tells you whether the baseline is stable enough to make detailed planning worth your time.</p>

              <h3>FAQ</h3>

              <h3>What counts as an essential expense for this diagnostic?</h3>
              <p>Essentials are costs that must be paid to keep your baseline functioning: housing, utilities, basic food, transport required to work and live, and required minimum debt repayments. Discretionary spending is excluded.</p>

              <h3>What is the coverage ratio and what does it mean?</h3>
              <p>The coverage ratio is monthly income divided by total essentials. Below 1.00 means essentials are higher than income. Higher ratios mean more buffer.</p>

              <h3>Why does the diagnostic not include savings as an essential?</h3>
              <p>Because this is a baseline structure check. If essentials are not covered, savings targets are not actionable. Once essentials are covered with margin, savings becomes the next layer.</p>

              <h3>What if my essentials include dependants or unavoidable support?</h3>
              <p>If the cost is truly mandatory and recurring, include it in essentials. The goal is not to look better on paper. The goal is to reflect your real baseline obligations.</p>

              <h3>What if my income is irregular?</h3>
              <p>Run the diagnostic using a conservative low-month income and a typical income. If the baseline breaks quickly in low months, you need a larger buffer in typical months.</p>

              <h3>Does this diagnostic tell me what to cut?</h3>
              <p>No. The free output gives two immediate actions only. It is designed to signal readiness and highlight the biggest essentials drivers, not replace a planner.</p>

              <h3>Is a stable result a guarantee I am financially safe?</h3>
              <p>No. Stable means income covers essentials with margin under normal conditions. It does not model shocks, future commitments, emergencies, or large one-off costs.</p>

              <h3>What should I do if I am underprepared?</h3>
              <p>Quantify the essentials gap and identify the dominant essentials driver. Then choose a correction move that is large enough to close the gap, not a collection of small cuts that do not move the ratio.</p>

              <h3>How often should I re-run this diagnostic?</h3>
              <p>Re-run it after any income change, housing change, new debt, or recurring cost increase. Otherwise, a monthly or quarterly check is enough to catch lifestyle creep.</p>

              <h3>What is a reasonable buffer after essentials?</h3>
              <p>There is no single universal number because volatility differs by household. The purpose of the stable threshold is to indicate that you likely have margin, not to define the perfect buffer for every case.</p>

              <h3>Can this be used for households instead of individuals?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Combine household net income and combined household essentials. The ratio still works as a baseline structure check.</p>

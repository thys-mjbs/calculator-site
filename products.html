            Each product here is built to solve a specific, recurring problem with clarity and structure. When you click a product, you’ll be redirected to Gumroad, where all SnapCalc products are securely hosted, delivered, and supported. Gumroad is our chosen platform for payments and product access, so the checkout and download experience happens there by design. You’ll always know exactly what you’re getting before you buy.

          <h2>What these products are and how to use them</h2>

          <p>
            This directory exists for one reason: to make it easy to find a specific outcome and buy the shortest path to
            it. The products listed here are not “nice to have” downloads and they are not generic templates meant to
            impress you. Each product is built around a common failure mode that wastes money, time, attention, or
            momentum. The aim is not entertainment. The aim is a practical change in behaviour or a cleaner decision made
            faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most people try to solve problems by collecting random advice, watching videos, and reading opinion threads.
            That feels productive, but it usually produces noise. You get partial ideas, you do not get a system. A system
            is what survives stress. A system is what survives fatigue. A system is what still works when you have to make
            decisions quickly. These products are designed as systems: short, structured, and biased toward action.
          </p>

          <p>
            The general pattern is simple. A product will help you identify a problem clearly, quantify the impact where
            possible, and then walk you through a sequence that reduces the problem with minimal friction. You should not
            need perfect information to start. If a product requires perfect data, it will fail in real life. The goal is
            to start with what you know, improve the quality of your inputs as you go, and make a better decision than you
            would have made without the structure.
          </p>

          <h3>What you can expect inside a typical product</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear definitions, so you stop arguing with yourself about what the problem actually is.</li>
            <li>A quick diagnostic step, so you can locate the highest-impact bottleneck first.</li>
            <li>Simple rules that reduce decision fatigue and prevent repeat mistakes.</li>
            <li>Checklists, prompts, or templates that turn thinking into actions you can execute.</li>
            <li>Optional depth if you want it, without blocking the base result.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What these products are not</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>They are not therapy, medical advice, or legal advice.</li>
            <li>They are not “motivation” content.</li>
            <li>They are not long reading projects that require hours before anything changes.</li>
            <li>They are not one-size-fits-all claims of guaranteed outcomes.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you want a clean way to choose a product, use this rule. Pick the thing that is costing you money or peace
            right now, not the thing that sounds interesting. Interest fades. Urgency stays. If a product helps you stop a
            recurring leak, it pays for itself repeatedly. If it only gives you something to read, it does nothing.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should also be honest about your constraints. If you have low energy, choose the product with the lowest
            activation cost. If you have time but no clarity, choose the product that forces prioritisation. If you have
            clarity but no discipline, choose the product that adds guardrails. The best product is the one you will
            actually use under real conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, this directory will expand across different problem categories. Some will be financial. Some will
            be operational. Some will be personal decision-making problems that quietly destroy outcomes. The common thread
            is always the same: you are losing something repeatedly, you cannot see it cleanly, and you need a structured
            way to stop it.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you click a tile and it takes you to Gumroad, you will see the full description, what is included, and who
            it is for. Keep your selection simple. Buy one thing, use it, extract the result, then move on. The fastest
            way to waste money is to collect products you do not execute.
          </p>

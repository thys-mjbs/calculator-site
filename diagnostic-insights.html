          <h2>What Diagnostic Insights are and what they are for</h2>

          <p>
            Diagnostic Insights exist for people who can feel that something is wrong, but cannot isolate the cause fast
            enough to fix it. Most personal and business problems are not mysterious. They are blurred. You have too many
            variables, too much emotion, and not enough structure. So you drift. Drift looks harmless day to day, but it
            compounds into waste, conflict, and expensive decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Diagnostic Insight page is designed to reduce that blur. It takes one common problem pattern and forces
            clarity through a short sequence. You identify the symptom, test the likely causes, quantify the damage where
            possible, and then choose a next step that is small enough to execute. This is not about motivation. This is
            about reducing the number of decisions you need to make, so you can move.
          </p>

          <p>
            These pages will often include a simple tool or input step. The tool is not the product by itself. The tool is
            the trigger that makes the problem visible. Once the result appears, the page can expand into an explanation
            that is specific to the problem you are experiencing. That is where the insight lives. The reason the format is
            “report-like” is because generic advice does not work when the situation is messy. You need a diagnosis, not
            a slogan.
          </p>

          <h3>What happens when you click a tile</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You land on a focused page with one problem theme, not a broad category.</li>
            <li>You work through a short input step or checklist to generate a personalised result.</li>
            <li>You can optionally unlock a deeper report by exchanging an email address.</li>
            <li>The report explains what the result means, where you are losing ground, and what to do next.</li>
            <li>If there is a paid product for that theme, it is presented as the full resolution path.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What these insights target</h3>
          <p>
            The topics are intentionally broad. Some are financial, like recurring monthly leakage, poor cash decisions, or
            debt mismanagement. Some are operational, like chaotic workflows, poor follow-through, or lack of constraints.
            Some are personal decision problems, like staying stuck in patterns you already know are costly. The common
            thread is always a hidden or ignored cost. The cost might be money, time, stress, opportunity, or reputation.
            If the cost is real and repeats, it belongs here.
          </p>

          <p>
            One practical example is a leakage pattern. People often know they are overspending, but they cannot locate the
            source with enough precision to change it. They cut obvious items and nothing changes. That is usually because
            the leakage is structural: timing, habits, subscriptions, small repeated purchases, or quiet decisions made
            under stress. A Diagnostic Insight designed for leakage does not just tell you to “budget”. It forces you to
            measure where the leak actually is, then proposes the smallest intervention that will actually move the number.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another common pattern is decision overload. When everything feels urgent, you treat everything as equal and
            you default to reaction. These pages can be used to impose triage. If you do not know what to fix first, you
            will fix nothing. Good triage is not complicated. It is a consistent rule that removes debate and forces a
            priority order.
          </p>

          <p>
            The point is not to be perfect. The point is to stop bleeding quietly. If you are losing ground each week, you
            do not need a new identity. You need a constraint. You need a system that is simple enough to run when you are
            tired. That is what the insights are built for.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, the directory will expand. The format stays stable: one theme per page, one core action, clear
            result, optional deep report, and then a practical resolution path. If a page cannot produce clarity quickly,
            it does not belong here.
          </p>
